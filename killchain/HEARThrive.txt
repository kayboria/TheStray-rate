Blood Tests to avoid heart disease

Causes of Heart Disease:
- Insulin Resistance syndrome [Metabolic Syndrome]
- Inflamation


Insulin Resistance syndrome 

{
	[
		when we eat sweet desserts that are high in sugar/carbs such as rice, potatos, breads our blood sugar
		rises. pancreas increases the hormone insulin to manage your blood sugar. So too much sugar and too much
		insulin puts you at risk of heart disease 
	]

	[	if you have high blood sugar you should be worried.
		- it is your ticket toward diabetes and heart diseases.
		- diabetes can lead to serious health complications.
		- including amputation to your legs, kidney failure
		  and blidness and it could knock 8 years off your life.
	]

	[these are five tests that will help you aassess your heart disease risk from the perspective of sugar and insulin]

	1 - Fasting Glucose [fasting blood sugar]
	{
		- this test measuers the glucose level in your blood after not eating any food for at lease 10 hrs

		- everyone has some sugar circulating in their blood.
		- the fasting glucose test measures how much sugar is present after not eating at least 10 hrs
		  preferably 12 hrs
		- the average person has about 5 liters of blood in their body (5 cartons of 1 liter milk)
		- there should be 1 tsp/ 4 gram sugar in the 5 cartons of blood
		- to know how sensitive your body is ....
		    - 4g sugar = 85 mg/dL
		    - 10g sugar = 200 mg/dL (Diabetes)
		- healthier goal is to consume no more than 15-20 net grams of carbs per meal
		- when you calculate the carbs, minus Fibres from carbs to get net grams of carbs
		- you can be sure your blood sugar would spike like crazy after eating high glycemic carb food like paste
		- avoid eating eggs that are mass-produced in a factory farm or CAFO (concentrated animal food operation)
		- The American Heart Association says that the amount of added sugar you should eat in a day are 
		  - for men 37.5 or 9 teaspoons of sugar
		  - for women 25 g or about 6 teaspoons of sugar
		- wheat-based products convert quickly to sugar in your body that poses a cardiovascular
		  risk that most people fail to recognize
		- throughout the HEARThrive program you will hearing a lot more about wheat and why
		  it must be avoided
		- particular food might be causing your blood sugar to rise excessively after you eat, you should 
		  always keep your blood sugar well controlled to help avoid heart disease, much more demo of this in 
		  module 6 on Diagnostic procedure
		- eating large potato and waiting for 45 minutes your blood sugar will respond to up to 130 mg/dL
		- ideally, your blood sugar should remain under 100 after eating which you can achieve if you can
		  avoid high glycemic foods
		- module 8 of hearthrive show you how popcorn is bad for your blood sugar and considered as 
		  high glycemic food which makes it causing heart disease you can check that by eating popcorn
		  and check your blood sugar after 30 - 60 minutes after that 
		  [
		  	- The trouble with insulin is that is can become a pro-inflammatory
		  	  hormone leading you on a path toward heart disease, diabetes and 
		  	  Alzheimer's
		  	- malcom says he is not exaggregating when he say the information you learn
		  	  in module 8 could be life changing
		  	- malcom years ago subscribed to a health newsletter and the promotional
		  	  deal included this little booklet entitled "Cutting Edge Secrets for 
		  	  Healing your Heart"
		  	- the author of the book, Bob Livingston is not a doctor but malcom feel he's
		  	  certainly figured a few things
		  	- for example on page 36 he writes "The fixation on cholesterol as a major cause 
		  	  of heart disease defies the last 15 years of sciencec and deflects from real causes 
		  	  such as the damage (via glycation) that sugars such as glucose and fructose iniflict
		  	  on tissues including the lining of arteries causing chronic inflammation and resultant
		  	  palque"
		  	- many experts malcom follow today would say that is absolutely correct
		  	- so if that's the case, why are so many doctors still fixated on cholesterol ?
		  	- and notice the author says we've known the answer for 15 years
		  	- the book was published in 2009
		  	- 15 - 2009 = it means we've known the answer to heart disease sincee 1994
		  	- that's how long doctors have been chasing the wrong suspect, that's how long'
		  	  you've been given incorrect information
		  	- the author also writes "... and the generals of metabolic communication are
		  	  insulin and leptin"
		  	- by generals he means the factors of metabolic communication
		  	- he states "they (referring to insulin and leptin) are really what must be treated
		  	  to reverse heart disease, osteoporosis, obesity and to some extent aging itself"
		  	- and you could certainly add Alzheimer's and dementia to the list
		  	- in this module of HEARThrive you're going to discover how to figure
		  	  things out for yourself and how to take correct action to reduce your risk of heart 
		  	  disease diabetes and Alzheimer's, even if No One Knows Anything For Sure
		  	- in this segment malcom going to demonstrate clearly why it's important to
		  	  test fasting insulin with blood sugar and hemoglobin A1C
		  	- in October 15th 2014 malcom and myron went for a spectracell metabolic test
		  	- at the time malcom weighted 147.5 ibs, myron weighted 177.5 Ibs
		  	- the reason myron weighted more than malcom was he ate a more high-carb diet with 
		  	  items like bagels, bananas, potatos, starchy things that can contribute to
		  	  weight gain
		  	  Malcom
		  	  - Insulin 6.7 uIU/mL
		  	  - Glucose 80 mg/dL  
		  	  - Metabolic Syndrome Traits 1
		  	  - hba1c 5.4 uIU/mL
		  	  - Adiponectin 11.3 ug/ml
		  	  - C-Peptide 1.71 ng/mL
		  	  Myron
		  	  - Insulin 12.1 uIU/mL
		  	  - Glucose 80 mg/dL  
		  	  - Metabolic Syndrome Traits 2
		  	  - hba1c 5.3 uIU/mL
		  	  - Adiponectin 5.5 ug/ml
		  	  - C-Peptide 2.76 ng/mL
		  	- if you don't look at fasting insulin and just look at glucose and hba1c which is typical of what 
		  	  most doctors would do, you're going to miss the point that at this stage of the game malcolm actually
		  	  metabolically more healthy than his twin brother
		  	- the purpose of this heartfelt story is to help motivate you to reduce your sugar consumption
		  	  and learn how sugar can not only be destructive to your heart, but can also affect your brain
		  	- malcolm have a friend who he belive having some pretty troublesome memory issues for his age
		  	- he is not in denial about it and admits he is aware of the problem and concerned about
		  	  it too
		  	- some health experts malcolm follow say that excessive sugar consumption can play a role in
		  	  memory loss and even contribute to dementia and Alzheimer's disease
		  	- his friend admits he consumes too much sugar although to his credit he is lowering his instake
		  	- malcolm remember going over to his house years ago to watch a movie on his new big-screen TV. 
		  	  he offers malcolm a drink of kool-aid. malcolm accept because back then malcolm drank soda and other sugary drinks.
		  	  he tells malcolm he drinks Kool-Aids a lot. that was 2007. in 2008 malcolm and his wife invited
		  	  them to chinese meal to celebrate his birthday, at that point malcolm remark about eating here 
		  	  together "last time" and his friend has no recollection of it. at first glance t hat might not sound unusual
		  	  but let me give you some more background
		  	  - first of all, as couples we don't get together very often, malcolm like to think of
		  	    these ocassions as something special and malcolm believe his friend does as well
		  	  - based on that alone malcolm would think his friend would have remembered their prior dinner
		  	    at this particular chinese restaurant
		  	  - his wife did even though last time they had eaten here was 8 months ago in june 2007
		  	  - but there were a few other things taht happened taht made this 2007 meal memorable
		  	  - his friend's wife brought her son along who they were meeting for the firtst ime
		  	  - that's somewhat eventful and memorable in his opinion
		  	  - in addition he told his friend about an investment  opportunity
		  	  - it feels like he has a "black hole" in his brain, there is a gap there,
		  	    something is missing
		  	  - at the time, in feb 2008 his friend was celebrating his 47th birthday that is a 
		  	    very young age to be experiencing memory problems
		  	  - there are others malcolm could tell  that are equally if not more profound
		  	  - malcolm still get together with his freind accasionally and he seems to be alert and bright
		  	    but by his own admission he still has memory failures
		  	  - in 2016 he adopts a new puppy and invites some friends over to see it
		  	  - a month later when he is talking to these same people he mentions that he
		  	    should have them over to see his puppy
		  	  - they remind him that they have already been there done that
		  	- Brain experts like Dr. Daniel Amen say that brain disease that eventually manifests
		  	  as Alzheimer's can begin 10,20 even 30 years or more beforehand
		  	- it's bad enough to develop dementia in your 80's but if it happens 20 years sooner ...
		  	  tha's truly tragic as you miss out on the best retirement years of your life
		  	- by the time your doctor tells you you've got Alzheimer's it's kindof late, a 
		  	  little bit late to really do a whole heck of a lot about it so you've got to be proactive
		  	- you gotta make big moves today and one of these big moves is to reduce your sugar 
		  	  consumption seriously
		  	- another way to know if someone has dementia is the story of malcolm story
		  	- when she told them what about we watch a movie ? they agree shegave them 
		  	  teh list of tapes she has and go to the kitchen to bring tea
		  	- then she bring the tea and goes back again to the kitechen and suddenly came saying
		  	  "I know what we can do .. how about we watch a movie ?!"
		  	- malcolm and his wife was blown away !
		  	- malcolm have been reading about this is that the start of dementia can happen 15 even 20 years 
		  	  before the person really is fully developed with dementia
		  	- in other words this in his mind probably probed to be an early sign of
		  	  her eventual dementia
		  	- it got worse and worse as the time went on
		  	- it takes her an hour to do salmon can that would take her 10 minutes in healthy days
		  	- of course you probably know this but with dementia the short term memory is the worls
		  	- she couldremember things from her past she could tell lots of great stories
		  	- but ask her to tell us something just happened or just not remember something that 
		  	  happened a moment or two ago
		  	- that is an example of dementia
		  	- whem malcolms mom developed a full Alzheimer's she hide things and doesn't know here
		  	  she hide them and thought it was stolen
		  	- when she fall down and they lied her on the bed and ask her what happend she
		  	  was saying non commonsense an understanduble language which turned out when she
		  	  fall down she had hematoma in her brain that's like bleeding in her brain and pressure 
		  	- what is metabolic syndrome ?
		  	- if you have metabolic syndrome you're at a higher risk ofmany chronic diseases including
		  	  - heart disease
		  	  - diabetes
		  	  - Alzheimer's
		  	  - stroke
		  	  - cancer
		  	  - liver 
		  	    - NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)
		  	    - NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)
		  	  - disease
		  	  - polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
		  	  - sleep apnea
		  	  - and more
		  	- another thing you might hear is that metabolic syndrome
		  	  is becoming more and more prevalent
		  	- in the past you may have heard that 33% of US adults have metabolic
		  	  syndrome
		  	- that number is probably even higher now
		  	- another interesting statistic i hear is that 88% of people
		  	  have at least one metabolic syndrome trait
		  	- check out the list and see how many of the conditions you have
		  	- metabolic syndrome is defined as having 3 or more of the followingg conditions:
		  	  - abdominal obesity which is access fat aroundyour waist
		  	    - Men >40"
		  	    - women > 35"\
		  	    - Asian men > 35" 
		  	    - Asian women > 32"
		  	  - low HDL cholesterol
		  	    - Men < 40 mg/dL
		  	    - Women < 50 mg/dL
		  	  - High Triglycerides > 150 mg/dL
		  	  - this cut-off is quite lenient in malcolm opinion and the experts he follow recommend 
		  	    achieving a triglyceride under 75 mg/dL or preferablyt under 60 mg/dL
		  	  - Blood pressure > 135/85
		  	    - and that's based on takinig no medication for blood pressure
		  	  - fasting blood sugar > 100 mg/dL
		  	    - in module 6 of Hearthrive you learned how to test 
		  	    - #1 Waist circumference
		  	    - #4 Blood pressure
		  	    - #5 blood sugar
		  	- do the test and see if you are among the 12% people who can pass the test of not having
		  	  any of the conditions of metabolic syndrome
		  	- rice is a high glycemic because only 1 serving which is 1/3 cup is 25 g
		  	- the testing you do after a meal by an hr or 45 minutes is known as postprandial or 
		  	  after -meal blood sugar responses to food
		  	- it helps raise your awarenece of how much high-glycemic the food you're eating 
		  	- try a CGM (continuous glucose monitor)
		  	- the sugar in juice is high in fructose 
		  	- fructose is one of the worst sugars to consume of you go overboard with it
		  	- the liver converts it to fat and triglyceride which causes insulin resistance
		  	  and heart disease
		  	- any amount of canola can be toxic according to experts
		  	- so use butter instead of canola oil
		  	- fatty liver correlates with insulin resistance and can be a precursor or a sign of 
		  	 prediabetes or even diabetes
		  	- fatty liver doesn't occur from consuming too much fat but from consuming too much
		  	  sugar and carbs
		  	- the excess glucose leads to increased insulin resistance which drioves fat accumulation 
		  	  in your body and your liver
		  	- the trouble with mild fatty liver is that it can gradually become more serious 
		  	  fatty liver known as NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) 
		  	- and then eventually lead to cirrhosis (permanent scarring of the live) which can
		  	  lead to the need to have a liver transplant
		  	  malcolm encourage you to establish a baseline by getting an abdominal ultrasound and 
		  	  finding out whether you have fatty liver
		  	- remember too that a slim person can have fatty liver
		  	- another test that is commonly done and possibly correlates with fatty liver is a 
		  	  liver enzyme test called ALT (Alanine transaminase) which assess inflammation in the liver
		  	- after malcom addapted a more fatty regime and quite sugar and carbs he has no fatty liver
		  	- so even though he was eating more animal-based foods and more saturated fat a fatty liver
		  	  is not present
		  	- as mention fatty liver is not caused by the consumption of fats, it's caused by conmsumption of too 
		  	  much sugar and high-glycemic carbs
		  	- surprisingly you often can reverse fatty liver quite  quickly by eliminating thosedestructive foods
		  	- be aware that fructose is a form of sugar that is metabolized directly in the liver
		  	  and is an even bigger potential contributor to fatty liver disease
		  	- fatty liver  
		  	  - very common in obese people 
		  	  - very common in in type 2 diabetics 
		  	  - increasing in an alarming rate

		  	- optimal ALT value is about 20 - 25 U/L or under 

		  ]
		- avoid food that spikes your blood sugar
		- if you always get fasting blood sugar values above 110 mg/dL that is indicative of prediabtetes
		- if the fasting blood sugar is consistently above 126 mg/dL that suggests you have diabetes
		- don't hang your hat on just one blood test measure, ideally you should track your value over time
		- test your own blood sugar at home using glucometer before and after meals
		- when you wake up in the morning a hormone called "Cortisol" rises. this is a normal  response and it often
		  causes your blood sugar to increase a bit.
		- this is a normal called "Dawn Effect or Dawn Phenomenon"
		- wait a bit after getting out of bed and don't eat anything for hour or two before testing
		  your morning fasting glucose
		- some people g et nervous when they undergo blood testing. If you/re anxious it's possible 
		  your blood sugar will rise with stress.
		- another thing to be aware of that you can get quite nice fasting blood sugar values, and yet
		  they won't reveal that you on the way to becoming metabolically unhealthy, that is because
		  your insulin, which helps normalize blood sugar, is functioning well enough to keep your blood
		  sugar in a healthy range. but your body maybe using more and more insulin to accomplish this.
		  that is not a healthy situation. and that is why you have to look at a number of blood tests 
		  to get atruly reliable picture.
		- a key test to include is fasting insulin which doctors fail to test
		- go to the fasting insulin section to get better understanding of this very important marker
		- if you are eating a low glycemic breakfast Dr. Wiliam Davis says you want to see very little change
		  in your blood glucose after you've had your meal. He says retest your blood sugar
		  about 30 to 60 minutes after you started to eat like malcom got his glucose 85 to 86 mg/dL 
		  after eating. he took his dog for a walk for 40 minutes and the glucose dropped to 72 mg/dL
		
		- optimal value of 85 mg/dL (80 - 90 mg/dL)
		- HeartHrive tested his fasting blood golucose after 2 hrs of waking up to be
		  85 mg/dL with blood pressure 122/76 mmHg systolic over diastolic  with pulse at 82 bpm
	} 

	2 - Hemoglobin A1C [HbA1c]
	{
		- this test assesses your average blood sugar control over 3-months period.
		- can show whether a person is becoming diabetic which has major association with heart disease.

		- if you are concerned that you're aging faster than you'd like, you're going to really want 
		  to pay attention to this section on Hemoglobin A1c
		- did you know that sugar in your blood adheres to a protein in your blood called hemoglobin?
		- this process known as glycation, and the damage it casues can be measured with a Hemoglobin A1c test
		- Dr. Mark Houston explains more accurately that
		    "HbA1c shows how much blood glucose has been adhering to the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin
		    molecules in your red blood cells... over a period of time" 
		- because red blood cells survive approximately 3 months, Hemoglobin A1c measurement can tell  
		  you how much blood glucose has been sticking to your red blood cells in that period of time
		- if your hemoglobin A1c is high, it reflects that your blood glucose has been elevated for alot of
		  the time leading up to that test.
		- this occurs when you eat a poor diet with too much sugar, especially high fructose corn syrup found
		  in soda and high sugar fruit juices. also too many carbs , especially wheat and grain products such as bread
		  oatmeal, corn, rice and so on. as well as eating too often and not exercising.
		- when your hemoglobin A1c is high which again, means that your red blood cells are like "sugar coated"
		- that is very destructive for your body, you will be at an increased risk for heart disease from damage to the
		  endothelium in your arteries
		- you may age poorly, suffer with arthiris, eye issues including cataracts, glaucoma and even blindness,
		  kidney dysfunction/failure, Digestive problems, poor sleep, nerve problems/Peripheral neuropathy,
		  brain diseases including Alzheimer's/parkinson's
		- Dr Bret Scher - showed a higher risk of subclinical atherosclerosis [the buildup of plaque], even in people
		  with Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 or 5.6, that is why Dr. William Davis and Dr. Russel Jaffe recommend HbA1c under 5.0 ideal
		- caution: since Hemoglobin A1c measurement reflects more or less your average blood glucose over the last 3 months
		  we run into that same problem that we had with fasting glucose
		- you could have a good-looking fasting glucose level, but it could be misleading if we fail to look insulin
		  Insulin helps bring blood sugarunder control, but the key question is How much insulin is needed to achive this ?
		- a person whose pancreas crancking out lots of insulin to control blood sugar is not metabolically healthy.
		- this person may have fasting blood sugar and HbA1c in the normal range eve4ry time the doctor tests them.
		  and those values may continue to appear normal for many yearts thanks to their insulin production, but if 
		  the doctor isn't measuring the insulin there is no way of knowing whether thhe insulin being produced is well
		  above a healthy range.


		- the HbA1c measurement is a percent. an optimal healthy value is 5% or lower, and maybe slightly above
		  5%.
		- HbA1c under 5.6 is optimal
		- range 5.7 - 6.4 is a Borderline and suggestive of prediabetes
		- above 6.4 is a High riskand suggest you have diabetes.

	}

	3 - Fasting Insulin
	{
		- Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancrease to help you manage your blood sugar.
		- High values could indicate you are on your way to deveolping diabetes.

		- insulin is a hormone that manages the glucose in your blood by helping to move the 
		  sugar into your cells including fat cells, muscles and the liver. when this process
		  is working well not much insulin is required.
		- unfortunately, in many cases, as time goes on, more and more insulin is required to control
		  your blood sugar.
		- this means your cells are "less accepting" of the help insulin is offering. they are getting
		  resistant to the action of insulin. this is known as insulin resistance.
		- the scary thing is that you cloud have perfectly normal blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c
		  for 10 to 15 years while your insulin has already been raging  out of control all that time
		- what is overlooked is how much insulin is being called upon to control your blood sugar
		- you and your doctor will never know unless you do a fasting insulin test
		- your insulin may still be doing its job ... but lurking below the radar so to speak
		- so why you want to test your fasting insulin while your blood glucose and HbA1c are in an
		  optimal level ? 
		  "say I want to see if my insulin is achieving its goal while remaing at an optimal level" 
		  "if my fasting insulin level came in high, then it would mean my metabolic system is 
		  dysfunctional and that I likely have insulin resistance."
		- if a healthy person fasted for 12 hrs and then got a blood test to check their insulion level,
		  it would be low.
		- after all, if you have't eaten anything for 12 hrs, why would there be much insulin
		  circulating in your body if you're metabolically healthy person ?
		- but if you've wrecked the functions that should naturally be working.., and your blood cells
		  are overloaded with sugar from overconsumption of sugar and high glycemic carbs, and have
		  developed insulin resistance, it's very possible that even after fasting, your insulin level 
		  will be high
		- you have twofold risk of developing diabetes if your fasting insulin is 8 uIU/ml versus
		  5 uIU/ml.



		- an optimal level would be under 4 uIU/ml
	}

	4 - C-Peptide
	{
		- this test also relates t o insulin resistance [Hyperinsulinemia]. 
		- together with fasting insulin, you can learn whether you're on the path to diabetes
		- these tests can tell you about the danger much sooner than the Hemoglobin A1c.

		- C-peptide is associated with insulin and can help determine how well your pancreas is working
		- the beta cells in your pancreas are involved with the production of insulin, and C-Peptide can help
		  determine how well those beta cells are wokring.
		- for every molecule of C-peptide, there is one molecule of insulin, so if your C-peptide is high
		  your body or your pancreas is probably lots of insulin means your body having insulin resistance,
		  means you are eating carbs food.
		- if your C-Peptide value falls below the recommended reference range, that could mean you have Type I
		  diabetes and that your pancreas is producing no insulin
		- or, you might have Type II diabetes that has gotten to the stage where your pancreas and beta cells are 
		  now functioning very poorly and failing to produce much insulin


		- a normal C-peptide blood test which by the way should be done fasting for 12 hrs is 0.5 - 2.0 ng/ml
		- self decode lab uses 0.8 - 2.26 ng/ml
		- Boston Heart Lab uses 1.4 - 3.3 ng/ml

	}

	5 - Lipid Panel HDL & Triglycerides
	{
		- this is the typical cholesterol panel which includes HDL & Triglycerides
		- ignore most of the cholesterol values and only pay attention on HDL & Triglyceride values
		- Low DHL combined with high Triglycerides associated with insulin resistance.

		- Triglycerides are fats in your blood, but they're manufactured in the liver mainly from carbs
		- in other words, excess sugar and starchy carbs consumption (not fats consumed) cause triglycerides to increase
		- if you have high triglycerides and low HDL. .. Look out! that is a bad combination suggestive of insulin resistance
		  instead you need your triglycerides to be low and HDL to be high
		- most doctors and cariologists worry about high cholesterol and the key in on LDL cholesterol so called "bad cholesterol"
		- LDL can be lowered dramatically with statin medication
		- doctor love when they make a difference using medication
		- the problem with targeting LDL is that your attention taken off much more critical factors taht influence heart disease
		- Dr. Robert Lusting has an abysmal view of LDL, in a YouTube video he said 
		   - "... Looking at an LDL number and saying you're in good shape or not is garbage, useless, worse than useless
		   in fact detrimental."
		- so let;s forget about looking at LDL and total cholesterol number and instead we will focus more on
		  triglycerides and HDL because they are much more directly linked to your metabolic health and risk of heart disease

		- Many experts today says we don't have to worry about saturated fat and butter negatively
		  affecting our heart health, but that could be an oversimplification because some people
		  who carry certain genes might have to minimize dietary saturated fat and this will be
		  explained in hearthrive module 10 on genetics


		- an optimal number for triglycerides according to Dr. William Davis and other experts is
		  60 mg/dL or less
		- 150 mg/dL is way too high
		- optimal level of HDL is 60 mg/dL or higher


		- there are ways to lower triglycerides and raise HDL that don't require any medication
		- eliminate/drastically reduce your consumption of refined foods, starchy carbs, sugar and trans fats
		- ignore mainstream dietary advice that tells you to cutyour fat and cholesterol intake from food and
		  to eat lots of so-called healthy whole grains.
		- if you start eating more healthy fats than carbs, you are gonna see improvements in your metabolic health
		  and that translates into lower risk of heart disease
		- you will see more about that in the diet of HeartThrive
		- your triglycerides will go down and your HDL will go up, you will loss wait
		- keep in mind that your lipid number especially triglycerides and HDL could bethrown off somewhat if you get 
		  tested while you losing weight.
		- Dr. William Davis explains that when you lose weight fat is mobilized and your lipid numbers may rise as a result
		- in these circumstancees, doctors often tell their patients "you are doing everything wrong", you are going to have to find a doctor 
		  who's knowledgeable in low carb physiology
		- in HeartThrive module three on statins and cholesterol you are going to learn that cholesterol
		  is transported via lipoprotein particles in your blood
		- these particles can be measured using special blood tests, and they're a much better predictor of heart disease
		  than standard cholesterol values but if you have low triglycerides and high HDL there is a very good chance your
		  lipoprotein particle measurements will be favorable, more on that on module 3

		---------------


		- Hearthrive after triple bypass heartt surgery in may of 2016 they told him to take 
		  quite a lot of medications. some temporarilya and others to be taken the rest of his life
		- of course one of the prescriptions was for atorvastatin commonly knowns as Lipitor
		  designed to lower cholesterol and put him in the maximum dose 80 mg per 
		- he stopped after one week and said "I don't wanna take this SHIT (Statin High Intensity Therapy)"
		- calcium high scores to 479 is high and suggestive of atherosclerosis (i.e heart disease)
		- more about calcium scores in Hearthrive module 6
		- in "Wheat Belly Total Health" Dr. Davis gives several non drug strategies to improve cholesterol and
		  the more important (in his opinion) liporpotein numbers.
		- his approach begins with diet eliminating wheat and grains (including rye, oats, corn, ricee etc
		- as an added bonus, this is often accompanied by weight loss.
		- Dr. Davis recommends taking a few important supplements particularily vitamin D and fish oil
		- proper thyroid function is critical and Dr.Davis addresses this too
		- and beccause intestinal permeability leads to autoimmune dysfunction which in turn contributes
		  to or even causes heart disease
		- Dr. Davis explained how to optimize gut flora with probiotics and prebiotics
		- * what is a good LDL value ? a cardiologist oncee told hearthrive the only thing that matters 
		  when it comes to heart disease prevention is lowering your LDL cholesterol, he said the goal 
		  would be for me to bring Hearthrive LDL down to 70 mg/dL
		- that's the guieline for people with known heart disease like hearthrive.
		- often hearthrive read that if you don't have known heart disease, an LDL level of 100
		  is acceptable 
		- hearhrive standard reference range that shows in his result sheet when getting
		  blood work done is to keep LDL under 139
		- he got LDL level of 99 mg/dL
		- spectracell uses 40 to 130
		- website Lab Test Analyzer suggests that an optimal LDL should range 80 to 160
		- most doctors seeing an LDL above 200 would be shocked
		- world renowned lipidologist Dr. Thomas Dayspring mentioned in a YouTube video that an LDL
		  value over 200 is where he would get concerned 
		- Dr. Aseem Malhotra was interviewd by Dr. Mark Hyman in a podcast Dr. Malhotra explained
		  that William Castelli one of the co-directors of Framingham looked back the data
		  and in 1996 published a paper in Atherosclerosis stating the data showed that unless the 
		  LDL was above 300 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) that it was essentially useless as a biomarker for predicting heart
		  disease
		- WITH SUCH A HUGE RANGE OF WAHT A HEALTHY LEVEL OF LDL SHOULD BE IT'S NO WONDER THE
		  AVERAGE PATIENT WOULD BE CONFUSED
		- or it is possible as Dr. William Davis suggests that LDL is among the worst
		  markers to look at for cardiovascular risk
		- and yet it's the value your doctor will show you as his reason for putting yopu
		  on a statin drug
		- a drug that will almost invariably provide no cardiovascular risk benefit
		- making Hearthrive comes to the invetible conclusion that when it conmes 
		  to LDL,statins and heart disease No One Knows Anything For Sure (NOKAFS)
		- Dr. Davis is a cardiologist the author of "Wheat Belly and "undoctored" offers a number of
		  key health strategies to help reduce your heart disease risk.
		- most cardiologists would tell you to take a statin drug to lower your cholesterol
		  but not Dr. Davis who  says 
		  "you will learn that of all the steps you can take to gain control over coronary risk
		   the statin drug is the last on the list and of questionable or minimal benefits"
		- Dr Davis says the opposite about LDL role in heart disease:
		  "There is no longer any lingering doubt Lipoprotein assessments are substantially
		   superior to cholesterol assessments"
		- in 2014 malcom started started pretty good then the LDL particles got pretty high but luckily
		  it was large LDL which cholesterol
		- we come down to the small density particles  LDL three and four come int o a healthier range
		- he also got a little bit geting into yellow area that is because he had not an optimal
		  level of HDL of 45 mg/dL 
		- myron his brother eats high carbs so he start with much higher VLDL which correlates to having
		  higher triglycerides
		- the statin drugs myron takes brought his large LDL significantly lower than malcom
		- however the statin drugs doesn't help his HDL which was 35 mg/dL compared to his brother 
		  45 mg/dL
		- * similarily because of myron high carb diet his VLDL his significantly high than malcom
		  which the statins can't help. and high VLDL means having high triglycerides as well as lower HDL
		- and high triglyceride with lowe HDL is a potential indicator for insulin resistance
		- malcom have met with 5 cardiologists since his identical twin brother had
		  his quadruple heart bypass surgery in 2008 and they all basically say the same thing
		- they put the pressure on they tell you, you got to take aspirin, a beta blocker
		  and cholesterol lowering statin drugs.
		- one of the cardiologists he met in 2012 and turned out he was one of the very'
		  highly regarded cardiologist in his city
		- always remember the graphs he should to you in module 3 episode "comparing our cholesterol and lipoprotein values"
		- remember the three peeks the VLDL the cholesterol the HDL and the hidden things it tells like
		- when the VLDL (at the beginning of the chart) is high means the triglyceride is high means the HDL
		  is low which you will see at the end of the graph where you should see the line going low when the 
		  line at the start of the graph for VLDL is high
		- and also people who take statins get cholesterol (the middle peak) to be low because it is managed 
		- he prepared for the meeting. he went through blood tests, previous test results, thoughts in order
		  questions linedup
		- the things happened that doctor told him he need to take statins he refused the  doctor told him
		  he won't accept him as a patient
		- malcolm was chatting with us and saying this story in 3 march 2016 and he know that he has quite 
		  high calcium score of 479 which could cause heart disease
		- he was also saying that he has the confidence and the knowledge to avoid the 
		  booby trap beecause of everything he does in HEARThrive like Diet Exercise
		  stress sleep hormones gut and much more
		- after the video by 2 months he got tripple heart bypass 
		- after the operation he asked the surgeon that operated on him this question
		  "if he had listened to that cardiologist in 2012 who told him to take a statin,
		   baby aspirin and a beta blocker, could he have prevented needing this triple bypass?"
		- the surgeon replied "it would have happened anyway, there is a genetic predisposition in your family
		  to have coronary disease"
		- so if it would happen anyway, why the heck would he take 
		  - statin to lower cholesterol
		  - aspirin to thin his blood 
		  - beta blocker to relax his heart and lower blood pressure
		- since 2010 he knew he had a significant heart disease not to mention his identical brother
		  twin brother needing quadruple bypass in 2008
		- he says if regardless of what he did the end result wast hat he was ultimately going 
		  to need heart surgerry then in the end he is glad he followed the principle of HEARThrive 
		  just follwoing more natural approach rather then taking statins and medications
		- in 2008 after malcom's brother got quadruple heart bypass surgery malcom's plan was 
		  to get started on a cardiac workup as soon as possible and getting educated about heart
		  disease himself
		- in june 9th 2008 he went to the bookstore and picked up several books taht were related 
		  to heart and one on IBS
		- books that influenced his eating diet was from Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn entitled prevent
		  and reverse heart disease which was very much oriented toward eating a diet designed
		  to keep fat and oil completely out of your diet if you want to achieve heart health
		  as well as plant based
		- the second thing that influenced the way he was going to eat was after he had seen
		  a cardiologist in june 2008 and gave him a sheet on the dash diet
		- the dash diet is designed to help with hypertension but also a diet that minimize fats and
		  focuses more on the idea of eating fruites and grains and vegetables and lean meat.
		- he was suffering from IBS and bought a book entitled "IBS relief" on june 9th 2008
		- that book became the third thing that influenced his diet and changed how he ate
		- the kind of takeaways he had from that book that would be following with his diet to
		  help alleviate IBS included for example eating a diet that had a lot of fiber, whole wheat crackers
		  wheat bran muffins,cereal, whole wheat bread and so on
		- steered clear of fat and even protein to some extent and focues more on fiber and carbs
		- he was excited with his eating plan and noted it is going to be heart healthy as well
		- you should know by know if that was true !
		- malcom was logging all what he eat since he bought the books with the new diet that has 
		  no fats and focuses on carbs from may 2008 untill he made the cholesterol test in november 2008
		- when malcom revised back he knew what he diet-related mistrakes that lead him to heart bypass despite
		  eating in a way that his cholesterol values were quite low he ended up with heart disease
		  - he belived it was bad to consume fat
		  - as a result his diet was much too high in carbs and sugar due to fat avoidance
		  - he ate way too much fruit which means way too much sugar
		  - he was eating too frequently throughout the day with lots of snacking between
		    meals
		  - he was eating too close to bedtime and often that would be a snack far too
		    high in carbs and sugar such as cereal or fuit like a banana
		- his twin brother underwent a quadruple bypass in may 2008
		- after he was keeping up with this diet of high carbs for 6 months from may - november 2008
		  he did cholesterol test, his cholesterol was 166 mg/dL which is below 200 mg/dL and considered
		  to be normal.
		- LDL or bad cholesterol 111 mg/dL within the reference range as well
		- but the more important factor triglycerides and HDL. when you eatt too much
		  carbs your triglycerides get elevated.
		- his triglyceride was 119.5 mg/dL (damn!)
		- his HDL of 31.6 mg/dL (damn!)
		- you dontt want to have triglyceride to HDL ratio
		- in his case 119.5/31.6 mg/dL = 3.78
		- a better target is 2 or less preferably 1
		- let's see his blood workouot after 12 year, 2018 2019 2020, the opposite diet
		  of 2008 avoiding carbs minimize fruits eating primary fat and protein
		- eat less frequenlty throught the day
		- results 24 january 2020
		- cholesterol 360 mg/dL
		- HDL 69.9 mg/dL
		- Triglyceride 70.8 mg/dL 
		- the interesting thing is that it's possible this cholesterol profile as high as it looks
		  with those numbers is actually healthier cholesterol proile than the one had back on nobember
		  5th 2008
		- the way it can be illustrated is very simply that the triglyceride to HDL ratio which is 
		  close t to 1.01
		- what he said above is controversial and need more research
		- but at the bare minimum a man should have an HDL of at least 40 and preferably 50 and Davis encopurages 
		  60 or above AND HE REACHED 70 in 2020
		- Dave Feldman is a cholesterol geek who has done exceptional research and experimentation on
		  cholesterol and created calculator that will give you an idea based on three different studeies
		  what your cardiovascular risk is 
		- when he put his 2008 results in the calculator it indicated a higher risk of cardiovascular 
		  hard disease which he got in 2016
		- while his results from 2020 got all low (damn! nice!)
		- eating grains and fiber and fuit while avoiding fat proven to be a mistake
		- not only did it fail to improve his IBS but it also contributed to develop heart disease
		- as mentioned he was consuming exceed sugar and carb, that would cause his blood sugar to rise which in
		  turn causes glycation which is damaging to the cells in your body
		- coincident with that would be a high insulin reponse which is inflammation-provoking
		- when blood sugar is spiked with carbs it tends to provoke the development of small LDL particles
		  which in turn provokes atherosclerosis
		- that is reflected in a gigh triglyceride-HDL ratio reflecting insulin resistance
		  and poort metabolic health contributing to health disease
		- one reason his Irritable bowel probably never got better was because he continued
		  to eat a diet high in wheat and grains
		- he was never going to solve irritable bowel that way despite what he was reading in
		  the books he bought
		- having irritable bowel is a reflection of gut dysbiosis which can create chronnic inflammation
		  in the body
		- more about that in module 9
		- it sounds complicated but in a nutshell, it boils down to having leaky gut which allows toxins to
		  enter your bloodstream through your intestines and produce inflammation which in turn lead to heart 
		  disease
		   - [
	  			- Recently, in the past decade or two much has been learned about the role of gut health
	  	 		  and disease including heart disease 
	  			- the food you eat goes down your esophagus into your stomach then into your small intestine
	  	  		  then the large intestine and culminates with poop
	  			- the small intestine is critically important in the process
	  			- this is where nutrients are extracted and mobilized into your bloodstream
	  	  		  to nourish your body
	  			- it's a great system when it works properly
	  			- unfortunately, things can go wrong in the small intestine
	  			- gaps can form there which is known as intestinal permeability
	  			- certain particles should not get through the intestinal wall and into
	  	  	 	  the bloodstream but they do
	  	  	 	- the immune system does not recognize these paricles perceives them as foreign
	  	  	 	  invaders and goes into attack mode
	  	  	 	- it's meant to be a healing procecss, but inflammation occurs with this
	  	  	 	- recall that strange particles are moving through your bloodstream and blood
	  	  	 	  goes everywhere throughout your body
	  	  	 	- therefore, anythying is "fair game" and anything could be attacked
	  	  	 	- this is referred to as an autoimmune response
	  	  	 	- if the process goes on long enough you get an autoimmune disease or 
	  	  	 	  several autoimmune diseases
	  	  	 	- remember this your autoimmune condition can present for years long before you
	  	  	 	  or your doctor notices something is wrong 
	  	  	 	- you might get a skin disease such as eczema
	  	  	 	- your thyroid gland might be vulnerable to an attack causing
	  	  	 	  a disease called Hashimoto's
	  	  	 	- the autoimmune process could even play a role in the progressuin
	  	  	 	  of heart disease
	  	  	 	- in this module of HEARThrive the goal will be to determine whether you have 
	  	  	 	  an autoimmune disease and shy and what you can do about it
	  	  	 	- no two people alike however so you will be carving out your own personal journey
	  	  	 	  of discovery

	  	  	 	- Dr. Peter Osborne
	  	  	 	  " The world's leading minds say that autoimmunity is the cause for ALL disease
	  	  	 	    for cadiovascular disease, for cancer. even for depression and suicide"
	  	  	 	- Hippocrate who malcom believe was way head of his time when it comes to health
	  	  	 	  is credited with this slogan
	  	  	 	  "it's more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what 
	  	  	 	   sort of a disease a person has"
	  	  	 	- someone's always dying of something make malcom think about autoimmune disease and
	  	  	 	  the concepts taught in doctor Tom O'Bryan's book entitled "The Autoimmune Fix - How
	  	  	 	  to stop the hidden autoimmune Damage that keeps you sick, Fat and Tired Before it turns
	  	  	 	  into disease"
	  	  	 	- he explains that each of us has a weak link somewhere in our health chain and 
	  	  	 	  the weak link is different for each person
	  	  	 	- more importantly wherever that chain breaks i where your health problems begin
	  	  	 	  which could include any chronic or degenerative disease you might develop including
	  	  	 	  heart disease
	  	  	 	- he blames autoimmune disease on 3 main factors:
	  	  	 	  - Genetics
	  	  	 	  ( more on Genetics in module 10 of Hearthrive)
	  	  	 	  - environmental triggers
	  	  	 	  ( more about these factors in module 12 of Hearthrive)
	  	  	 	  - intestinal permeability
	  	  	 	  (covered in this module 9 of HEARThrive)
	  	  	 	- when you're coping with some stubborn mysterious ailment for which no
	  	  	 	  one seems to have the solution, just remember that 
	  	  	 	  "Someone's Always Dying ofSomething and the something is more than likely
	  	  	 	   an autoimmune issue"
	  	  	 	- when it comes to inflammation in the gut, another cause of all disease
	  	  	 	  according to Allison Siebecker is again related to the gut and it's called 
	  	  	 	  SIBO
	  	  	 	- she says that SIBO stand for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
	  	  	 	- and it occurs when you have too much bacteria and it's the wrong type
	  	  	 	  of bacteria in the wrong place
	  	  	 	- and by wrong place they mean it's kind of bacteria that should lower down
	  	  	 	  let's say in your colon and it somehow starts to creep up into your small
	  	  	 	  intestine
	  	  	 	- that's why it's called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth it's coming
	  	  	 	  up in the wrong direction
	  	  	 	- and as a results it gives all kinds of health problems according to her
	  	  	 	- and it says here that they could link SIBO to virtually every disease 
	  	  	 	- and at her website Dr. Siebecker has over 50 diseases and conditions that 
	  	  	 	  she mentions here's some of them listed righ here":
	  	  	 	  - Acne Rosacea and Acne Vulgaris
	  	  	 	  - Anemia
	  	  	 	  - Autism
	  	  	 	  - Chronic fatigue syndrome
	  	  	 	  - Gallstones
	  	  	 	  - GERD
	  	  	 	  - Hypothyroidism
	  	  	 	  - Pancreatitis
	  	  	 	  - Rheumatoid arthritis
	  	  	 	- and she mentions taht  SIBO is generally associated most commonly
	  	  	 	  with IBS, Crohn's disease and Celiac disease and Histamine
	  	  	 	- Dr. Davis tends to not go along with the concept of a customized
	  	  	 	  probiotic plan based on your poop sample
	  	  	 	- Dr Davis argues too that a poop sample isn't the best way to analyze 
	  	  	 	  what is going on inside your gut because by tghen the material has already passed
	  	  	 	  through your gut



	  	  	 	- people found when they simplify their diet and cut back to primarily eating meat
	  	  	 	  as their main source of nutrition, their abdominal symptoms improve considerably
	  	  	 	  and that happened to malcom as well
	  	  	 	- many chronic health conditions improve when you adopt a simple carnivore diet
	  	  	 	- the reason why is that it acts as an elimination diet
	  	  	 	- if you're struggling with a health problem that neither you nor your doctor has ever
	  	  	 	  able to solve, you might just want to try a carnivore diet for 30 to 90 days and
	  	  	 	  see what happens
	  	  	 	- Dr. Ken Berry's "proper human diet" is avery restricted diet which in somecases comes
	  	  	 	  down to nothing more than beef, butter, bacon and eggs
	  	  	 	- although you can expand on that to some degree, the lion's share of his dietary 
	  	  	 	  recommendations under his proper human diet umbrella very restricted compared to
	  	  	 	  what the average dietitian or even what Dr. Davis would recommend
	  	  	 	- tupycally most dietitians recommend both soluble fiber and insoluble fiber
	  	  	 	- you'll often heart his repeatedly in mainstream media
	  	  	 	- they believe the soluble fiber forms a gel or slurry in your intestine e.g aotmeal
	  	  	 	  that helps in various beneficial ways and insoluble fibre passes through your gut and gets
	  	  	 	  digested by bacteria in the large intestine producing additional benefits e.g whole wheat
	  	  	 	- while that fiber is not necessarily not exactly what Dr. Davis is suggesting, he is
	  	  	 	  arguing you need to have prebiotic fibers  approximately 20g per day and preferably
	  	  	 	  a mixed variety of them
	  	  	 	  - green banans
	  	  	 	  - Hummus
	  	  	 	  - Inulin
	  	  	 	  - kidney beans
	  	  	 	  - Lentils
	  	  	 	  - Chickpeas
	  	  	 	- and he belives these are the fibers that gut bacteria thrive upon and help
	  	  	 	  produce a healthy microbiome. 
	  	  	 	- both in terms of diversity and even supporting specific bacterial strains that are 
	  	  	 	  believed to be beneficial
	  	  	 	- in 2014 malcom was watching KSPS a public broadcasting TV station
	  	  	 	- Dr. David Perlmutter author of the book "Grain Brain" wasspeaking about problmes
	  	  	 	  associated gluten
	  	  	 	- he got malcom's attention when he said "Another reason people come to seee me
	  	  	 	  are for things called movement disorders"  and he continued" These can be 
	  	  	 	  things like a simple tremor, or more aggressive movement disorders where
	  	  	 	  the arms and legs move called Myoclonus"
	  	  	 	- he said these movement disorders were very common and often affected people 
	  	  	 	  who were sensitive to gluten
	  	  	 	- He explained that people's lives could be profoundly compromised by movement disorder
	  	  	 	  but this could be corrected by removing gluten from their diets
	  	  	 	- One solution doctors had suggested was to inject this patient's arms and
	  	  	 	  legs with botox
	  	  	 	- instead Dr. Perlmutter put him on a gluten-free diet and after 9 months
	  	  	 	  his tremors were gone
	  	  	 	- malcom was thrilled that he could finally put a name to his trembling problem
	  	  	 	- even though Dr. Perlmutter was very familiar with Myoclonus and was routinely
	  	  	 	  treating people none of malcom's doctors had a clue what it could be
	  	  	 	- that included the doctor he saw at the clinic, the doctor he saw in the emeregency
	  	  	 	  department at the hospital, his family doctor and movement disorder specialist
	  	  	 	- malcom now realize that his trembling issue that started in 2004 was another
	  	  	 	  manifestation of gluten sensitivity thatt caused him eczema in the year 2000
	  	  	 	  and plagued him with digestive problems for many years prior to that
	  	  	 	- his body's response to inflammation manifested itself in his gut and on his skin
	  	  	 	  and then his brain or nervous system
	  	  	 	- he don't have celiac disease but he do have sensetivities to gluten
	  	  	 	- 
	  	  	 	- a person's inflammation could lead to Crohn's disease or Lupus or Hashimoto's 
	  	  	 	  (a thyroid disease) or many illness including heart disease
	  	  	 	- it wasn't untill 2011 that he permanently re-established an eating style similar
	  	  	 	  to the SCD that had helped him clear his eczema in the year 2000
	  	  	 	- Dr. William Davis published "Wheat Belly" in 2011 and he immediately recognized 
	  	  	 	  the benefits of adoppting his approach
	  	  	 	- Dr. Davis is a cardiologist and his book was based on his success with 
	  	  	 	  heart disease patients and what he learned from treating them
	  	  	 	- and as discussed in HEARThrive module 2 on Diet,  malcom was hooked on
	  	  	 	  wheat belly
	  	  	 	- malcom no longer have any trembling episodes, it's no longer a worry
	  	  	 	- his sleep is no longer distrupted, he sleep well and feel well rested ion the 
	  	  	 	  morning 
	  	  	 	- some of the symptoms associated with his trembling resembled anxiety like a 
	  	  	 	  person might feel if he was anticipating getting fired from his job the next day
	  	  	 	  or receiving a life-changing decision from a jury
	  	  	 	- but for malcom it wasn't anxiety, nor was it a neurological problem nor was
	  	  	 	  it a brain tumour
	  	  	 	- it all came down to being diet problem
	  	  	 	- an easy fix once you know the reason
	  	  	 	- and finally why is this segments's heartfelt story relevant to heart disease ?
	  	  	 	- it's relevant because it illustrates that when your body is a constant stateof 
	  	  	 	  inflammation, you are a greater risk to develop heart disease
	  	  	 	- don't ignore the clues which can manifest as a wide range of autoimmune disease that
	  	  	 	  that you and your doctor might never associate with the heart
	  	  	 	- if you don't feel right, startt investigating
	  	  	 	- don't accept how you feel being a "new normal" that you have to accept and live with
	  	  	 	- there is no need to keep suffering year after year
	  	  	 	- your doctor may not be able to help you get to the root of your problem
	  	  	 	- malcom's story illustrates that very clearly
	  	  	 	- begin by eliminating grains from your diet - starting with Wheat
	  	  	 	- on march 23rd 2006 malcolm and his doctor agreed to cut to thechase and find out
	  	  	 	  once and for all what's going on becuase of his IBS
	  	  	 	- he had his first  colonoscopy
	  	  	 	- but as is typical of the case with people who has IBS and get colonoscopies nothing
	  	  	 	  particularly troubling was found
	  	  	 	- no polyps no cancer no diverticula in the colon. no inflammation or 
	  	  	 	  ulceration .. nothing
	  	  	 	- when you have IBS for many years like malcolm it means you havee leaky gut
	  	  	 	- you have the potential for what's called endotoxemia which is 
	  	  	 	  essentially toxins inside your system that can leak out and move anywhre
	  	  	 	  via your bloodstream and produce autoimmune disease
	  	  	 	- tthe toxins will aggravate your body in different places
	  	  	 	- and genetics often dicrtate where you're more prone to have problems
	  	  	 	- in malcolms case he believe his weakest link was his heart
	  	  	 	- there for endotoxemia and leaky gut would have had their most
	  	  	 	  destructive influence on his heart
	  	  	 	- and because he adopted that different IBS diet on nov 30th 2006
	  	  	 	  he beliebe he made matters worse and he will explaing why but get 
	  	  	 	  ready to what not to do
	  	  	 	- malcolm was eating frequently throughout the day as well
	  	  	 	- from a metabolic standpoint that's not healthy either, and that's because you're always
	  	  	 	  raising your blood sugar every time you eat
	  	  	 	- this increases the chance for atherogenic LDL particles to accrue and damage your arterial health
	  	  	 	- wheat products are notorious for creating leaky gut which means they don't solve IBS they cause it
	  	  	 	- all of these factors can contribute to endotoxemia inflammation and ultimately heart disease

		- How to calculate 
		  your Triglyceride - HDL Ratio
		- for the following mmol/L values of Cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol
		  multiply them with 38.6 while Triglyceride multiple with 88.5 to get mg/dL
		- you have to be fasting for this test when you get your lipid panel done, otherwise sone of the
		  values especially triglycerides won't be valid
		- after multiplying devide Trig:HDL ratio
		- you want a ratio under 2 and preferably closer to 1
		- malcom test Lipid Panel in 04-Feb-2017 was 
		  - cholesterol 195 mg/dL
		  - HDL cholesterol 45 mg/dL
		  - LDL cholesterol 137 mg/dL
		  - Triglyceride 64.6 mg/dL
		  - non-HDL cholesterol 150 mg/dL
		  - trig:HDL ratio = 64.6/45 = 1.4
		- your cholesterol results Don't be myopic!
		- he show us his father's blood work and use it as an example to illustrate how myopic
		  or nearsighted your doctor night be when evaluating a lipid panel
		  - cholesterol 160 mg/dL
		  - triglyceride 204 mg/dL
		  - HDL cholesterol 34 mg/dL
		  - LDL calculated 86
		- the test was done on july 30th 2007
		- his father was 88
		- his cholesterol of 160 mg/dL considered good he uses benchmark of 200 mg/dL or less
		- the doctor said his results are very very good
		- no infection in the body, his calcium is fine, his blood count was fine, no cancer, 
		  B12 level was creeping up a little which was good, thyroid wasfine in his opinion
		- and then get this, he said his cholesterol was excellent
		- keep that in mind as we continue through this discussion
		- he is sure one of the reasons he the doctor said his father's cholesterol was great was because 
		  he was looking at things like his LDL the so-called bad cholesterol
		- and it was only 86 mg/dL which is nice and low 
		- in fact, quite often when doctors are looking at patients and they want to limit their 
		  cardiovascular risk, they belive that a value of about 70 mg/dL is optimal and they usually
		  achieve that by giving them statins and sure enough at this pointt in time his father was 
		  taking a low dose statin he was taking 10 mg of simvastatin known as Zocor which is approximately 
		  equivalent to just a 5 mg dose of Lipitor so it is pretty low statin dose
		- so the doctor said his cholesterol was excellent
		- malcom didnot know how to critique that information and just accepted that value as
		  most patients would
		- malcom want to show us why that was a very ver y myopic view of his father cholesterol level
		  - Trigs
		  - optimal 60 or less
		  - So-So up to 100
		  - Yuck ip to 150
		- his father has elevated triglyceride, it's reflective of a diet that is far too glycemic, in other words
		  far too heavy in sugar which happen from eating too many carbs and too much added sugar and processed foods
		  in general
		- his father definitely fit that category, he loved a sweet treat after every meal
		  he enjoyed his orange juice and cereal in the morning and he always had to have bread
		  with every meal
		- all those high carb foods will cause triglyceride levels to be elevated
		- his father trig:HDL ratio is 6.0
		- The wrong canadian bochure about lowering LDL
		- Meat and Substitutes
		- we now know it is not absolutely essential to eat lean meat or remove the skin from chicken
		  instead you should be paying attention to whether you're eatingg grass-fed and grass-finishedbeef
		  or bison and organic free range chicken and turkey
		- he agree that fish and seafood are good choices but again it's more important to eat wild caught
		  fish and avoid farmed fish which are raised in toxic environment also avoid eating fish taht 
		  are  higher in the food chain such as tuna, shark and swordfish and more susceptible to mercury toxicity
		- putting fish in the "best choice" column makes sense because Omega-3 fatty oil in fish helps reduce oxidation
		  of cholesterol and lowers triglycerides which is heart healthy
		- legumes are shown in the "best choice" column but that's misleading for example chickpeas and pito beans
		  are legumes but you don't want to be eating them because they are very high in carbs which mneans they can
		  spike your blood sugar
		  - 100 grams of chickpeas 
		  - 61 g carbs
		  - 17 g fiber
		  - 61 - 17 = 44 g of astonishing net carbs
		- instead of being "best choice" some of the experts malcom follow would suggest legumes be eaten in small
		  amounts or even avoided 
		- tofu is a soy product and most commercial brands are GMO and grown with toxic pesticides sucj as glyphosate
		- malcom would put any non-fermented soy in the "avoid" category nutritionally soy and tofu are poor substitutes
		  for red meat which is rich in B12 , iron and zinc
		- in keeping with low fat and low cholesterol regiment, they tell you to limit egg yolk
		  nuts and shrimp
		- malcom said he doesn't eat shrimp but if he did he would be more concerned
		  about whether it was farmed and less worried about its fat content
		- egg yolks contain cholesterol, but so what ? there is no need to limit dietary cholesterol
		  and you won't get heart disease from eating eggs, they may even help raise your HDL
		  again look for eggs that come from farm-raised chickens and not from confined mass-produced
		  operations
		- Nuts and seeds should not be in the limited column unless perhaps ypu have trouble digesting them
		  they contain healthy fats
		- the brochure also tells you to avoid fatty cuts of meat, bacon, sausages, procecssed meat and organ meats
		- Dr. William Davis who is a cardiologist would agree with not eating processed meat but otherwise he 
		  recommends the exact opposite, he says go ahead and eat fatty cuts of beef such as rib-eye steaks
		  he think he's right and this fat phobic brochure is wrong
		- there is no need to avoid bacon and sausages if you make intelligent choices. for example 
		  you can buy good bacon that comes from humanly raised animal or buy bad bacon from confined 
		  animal operations that use hormones and antibiotics on the pigs add preservatives, nitrates
		  and then nitrate the meat and then sweeten the bacon with added sugar
		- the same is true for unhealthy sausages 
		- for many people, dairy products in general are inflammationary and difficult to gdigest
		- they should all be avoided or eaten in small amount at best whether it's 1%, 2% or whole milk
		  it belongs to the "avoid" column
		- commercial milk from cows treated with hormones and antibiotics and then pasteurized and 
		  hormogenized yields a product that serves little purpose in your health and if anything possibly contributes
		  to heart disease 
		- on the bochure chart, skim or low fat dairy products are recommended often people heed that advice
		  and endup eating low-fat yohurt but it's sweetended with sugar that is what you need to avoid
		- if you pick unsweetened yogurt, that is higher in fat, it's actually superior choice
		- similarly, avoiding regular cheese and cream as shown in the chart because they are higher in fat is 
		  misguided advice
		- Gouda cheese from grass-fed cows contains vitamin K2 that can benefit arterial health
		- but some experts suggest avoiding all cheese because it may contribute to inflammation
		- malcom use unsweetened almond milk which has a net carb count of zero
		- coconut milk unsweetened is fine
		- but avoid rice milk because it is high carb 
		- according to nutrition specialist mike Geary, green tea is terrific for several reasons
		  - it has antioxidant properties
		  - it can slow the rise of blood sugar after eating and lower LDL and triglycerides
		  - all which move your heart health in a positive direction
		- fruits and veges
		- fruits are high in sugar
		- berries for example which are lower in sugar are better choice than tropical fruit
		  such as pineaple
		- vegetables too range in carbs content
		- pick lower carb vegetables like romaine lettuce, spinach, brocoli, cauliflower and go
		  easy on higher carbs veggies like carrots and sweet potatoes
		- go to farmer's market when possible and aim for organic fuits and vegetables
		  preferably grown locally
		- there is no need to limit olives and avocados just because they are higher in fat
		- remember, this guide was produced with a fat phobic philosophy that is just plain wrong
		- avocados are a great source ofoleic acid and they are rich in potassium too making them a heart
		  friendly choice
		- it probably makessense to avoid deep fried  vegetables it's not so much the fat issue as it
		  is  the potential for the oil become toxic at high temperatures 
		- Grains
		- they want you to enjoy whole grain products: breads, pita, english myffin, bagel, rice, pasta
		  cereals
		- all of these should be completely off your menu
		- amylopectin A is a carb in wheat that is known to raise blood sugar and promote insulin resisteance
		- there is a bunch of other stuff wrong with grains that Dr. Wiliam Davis  talks about in his book
		  "Wheat Belly" including the proteins that are destructive to your gut leading to autoimmune 
		  problems that can provoke cardiovascular disease
		- to put olive oil and canola oil in the same group is ridiculous
		- if you choose good brand olive oil it's not even the same league as cannola oil they shoudln't be lumped together
		- do remember however that even healthy oild like cold pressed olive oil can become inflammatory when
		  heated too much when cooking or baking
		- malcom would avoid most of these oils especially canola and safflower as well as margarine of any type
		- even if it's non-hydrogenated
		- why would you want to eat an artificially produced product when you can have real butter ?
		- canola oils is destructive to your health and may even contain harmful trans fats and oxidized fats
		- Dr. Steven Sinatra says most commercial brands are refined with chemicals and petroleum solvents
		  high tempretures
		- according to the chart nuts and seeds should be limited 
		- malcom think this has some merit because some not all contain a significant proportion of mega-6fatty
		  acids which are pro-inflammatory
		- nevertheless nuts are nutritious
		- many contain magnesium and potassium and antioxidants which make them heart healthy
		- nuts and seeds can be included in heart healthy diet but not the way they are typically sold
		- often you will see canola, soybean and safflower oil has been added not to mention flavorful
		  embellishments including honey and sugar
		- you should buy raw nuts preferably organic
		- you can toast them in the oven yourself usisng light to moderate heat 170 to 250 Fahrenheit without
		  adding anything else or perhaps just some salt or basic seasonings
		- some people may need to limit nuts because the yare difficult to digest 
		- it is important to chew them thoroughly
		- they want you to limit low-fat salad dressing as well probably because it may include some oil
		- the real reason to not just limit but even avoid low-fat dressing is that it probably contains added
		  sugar
		- i am noticing malcom has an ideology that anything low in fat is high in sugar
		- you/re likely better off if you use full-fat salad dressing
		- for daecades we have been told to avoid butter, lard, bacon fat, and tropical oils such as cocount
		  and palm oil and this heart healthy brochure reinforces that message
		- unfortunately, it's the wrong message it is bad advice it is outdated and base
		  on flawed science
		- saturated fat has now been shown not to cause heart disease
		- yes it may raise your LDL but that does not matter
		- eating more fat and minimizing sugar tends to improve your lipoprotein numbers - fewer atherogenic small
		  particles and more large ones which you want 
		- when you replace a sugary high-carb diet like the so-called heart healthy one being shown on this brochure
		- with a low-carb diet that includes more fat you will discover other improvements in your lipid profile
		- your HDL will probably increase which is good and your triglyceride will get lower which is also good
		- malcom agree with the bochure avoiding margarine or any margarine for that matter
		- have you ever looked at the list of ingredients for margarine ?
		- stick with butter which is a real food a single ingredient food even better eat grass-fed butter
		  from pastured animals
		- I hope by now you understand the reasons why you don't get heart disease eating food with saturated fat
		  and cholesterol
		- you get it from eating escessive amount of sugar and carbs
		- note some people have a genetic marker called ApoE4 and they may do better going easy on fats
		- malcom will cover this in module 10 on genetics

Inflamation

[hidden inflamation that you are not aware of, but can be really deadly]
[think of the word inflammation as the word healing]
[
	- there's another type of hidden inflammation that goes on in your body as well, it is called chronic inflammation
	you're damaging yourself and perhaps killing yourself without even knowing that it's happening 
]
[
	- these test going to help you detect whether inflammation is happening in your body and once again, think of that as
	  healing happening in your body
	- the  key questions to ask yourself are why is this healing happening and why is it necessary ?
	- I must have done something wrong or I'm doing something wrong that's cauing my body to have to keep healing 
	  itself all the time
	- this will make it a lot easier to understand what these blood tests mean
	- they address chronic inflammation, or chronic healing - healing that has to keep happening because something's 
	  wrong in your body
]


6 - hsCRP [high sensitive C-Reactive Protein]
{
	- this test measures high sensitive C-Reactive Protein is related to inflamation in your body
	and an increased risk of heart disease

	- this protein is manufacctured in your liver when there is inflammation in your body.
	- although there is a standard test called CRP, it's important that you request hsCRP when evaluating
	  your heart disease risk
	- there are many other inflammatory conditions that can raise hsCRP, therefore, it's not an absolute risk marker
	  for heart disease but something worth tracking
	- you could have an infection or inflammation in your body that you may or may not even know of and sure
	  enough your hsCRP will be elevated
	- other inflammatory conditions that might raise hsCRP include:
	  - arthritis flare-up
	  - urinary tract infection
	  - gum disease
	  - poor sleep before the test
	  - having big belly with lots of abdominal fat
	- other serious health conditions that could produce a high hsCRP number include:
	  - crohn's disease
	  - ulcerative colitis
	    - diabetes
	  - high blood pressure etc.
	- hsCRP is an inexpensive routin blood test so I encourage you to ask your doctor to run for you every year
	  maybe every six months


	- under 1.0 mg/L (or 0.5) low risk
	- some experts in fact prefer 0.5 or less
	- from 1.0 - 3.0 average - Borderline
	- above 3.0 increased risk


	- keep your hsCRP at a healthy level
	- Dr. william Davis of course suggests we avoid wheat, grains, expecially those containing glutens and
	  sugar that are known to provoke inflammation
	- Tim Burmaster suggest we avoid sugar and alcohol and processed food and maintain a healthy omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in our diet
	- other suggestion include managing stress and getting proper sleep which will cover in heartthrive module 11
	- avoid environmental allergens and toxins which will be in hearthrive module 12 
	- certain supplement that could help support a healthy hsCRP value include:
	  - magnesium Glycinate
	  - vitamin K&D 120 mcg and 1000 IU
	  - CoQ10
	  - oil fish
	- more about this in module 5 in hearthrive
}

7- Homocysteine
{
	- this is an amino acid, which if elevated may cause damage to coronary arteries 
	and increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke

	- Dr. Al Sears says you can think of Homocysteine as being like car exhaust from a running engine 
	- it's an amino acid that is produced naturally in your body as a byproduct of metabolism
	- in other words, it's like a toxic waste product that your cells dump into your bloodstream as they burn energy
	- Dr. Mark Houston writes
	  "... Too much Homocysteine alters the environment inside the arteries and sets the stage for arterial disease."
	- Christine Wilde who has studied heart disease extensively says
	   "... Homocysteine is associated with adverse 
	   - Platelet Aggregation
	   - Oxidation of LDL
	   - provoking the formation of plaque formation
	   "
	- in other words, high Homocysteine is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke
	- some studies suggest that  high homocysteine may be related to having low thyroid 
	  function, known as hypothyroidism
	- checking your thyroid get these 6 key blood tests
	  - TSH undoctored target 0.2 - 1.5 mIU/L
	  - Free T3
	  - Free T4
	  - Reverse T3
	  - Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody
	  - Thyroglobulin Antibody
	- more about how to solve thyroid problems in module 12 of HEARThrive
	- Myron has TSH of 4.5 Malcolm 2.0 
	- Myron's Thyroid abtibodies can tell he has Hashimoto's (elevated antibodies)
	- his thyroid ultrasound reveals a rough textured appearance indicative of a diseased thyroid
	- he has thyroid nodules
	- Malcolms has non
	- Malcolms takes iodine supplement as per undoctored inner circle advice
	- people who have high Lp(a) have it's combined with Homocysteine, even a greater risk of 
	  heart disease



	- Dr. Mark Houston explains levels above 6.0 umol/L could be problematic 
	- levels above 12.0 umol/L severe risk
	- Dr. David Jockers likes to see Homocysteine under 8.0 umol/L
	- Dr. Al Sears says value above 10.4 umol/L is abnormally high
	- and advices aiming below 7.0 umol/L
	- hearthrive advocates an optimal level between 6-7 umol/L
	- and acceptable range is 7 - 9


	- it is possile to lower Homocysteine 
	- first, you must understand that there is a biochemical preocess called methylation
	  going on in your body thousands of times a day
	- Methylatiion requires certain nutrients such as folate, vitamin B6 and B12 and others
	  including magnesium, zinc and trimethylglycine (TMG)
	- if these nutrients deficient, Homocysteine rises
	- poort diet high in sugar and carbs depletes B vitamins and magnesium and can cause 
	  Homocysteine to rise
	- problems with your gut including dysbiosis and insufficient stomach acid could also result 
	  in more absorption of B vitamins and magnesium and thereby cause Homocysteine to increase
	- more about gut health in module 9 of HEARTHrive

	- you maybe genetically predisposed to have high Homocysteine. you may have certain genetic 
	  mutations that impair the ability to absorb vitamins and magnesium thereby resulting in high 
	  homocysteine
	- hearthrive module 10 on Genetics
	- although high Homocysteine associated wikth increased cardiovascular risk, some experts say
	  there are studies where lowering it with supplements has not been shown to lower that risk
	 - it is possible in these studies that they weren't lowering Homocysteine enough to be helpful
	 - for example if the people going in had Homocysteine levels of let's say 14 umol/L reduced by
	   25% = 10.5 umol/L which 25% sound pretty good, but that may nopt be low enough to do any good 
}

8 - Fibrinogen
{
	- this is a blood protein associated with blood clotting and the formation of arterial plaque.

	- did you know you could have a heart attack and possibly die when plaque ruptures and a clot forms ?
	  and this could happen in a very critical artery in your heart and the scary thing is, this could happen
	  in a matter of minutes
	- so get ready to pay attention to fibrinogen, which has to do with clotting 
	- Fibrinogen is a blood protein made in the liver, it is involved with blood clotting and formation
	  of arterial plaque
	- it is also associated with the stickiness and viscosity of your blood
	- Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby explained that 
	  "... Fibrinogen is the precursor molecule that changes into fibrin when the blood clots"
	- in other word, high levels of Fibrinogen pose a greater heart disease risk for you
	- Dr Malcolm kendrick places Fibrinogen high on his list of cardiovascular risk factors
	- life extension says high homocysteine goes hand-in-hand with high fibrinogen, because 
	  having high homocysteine prevents the breakdown of fibrinogen
	- if you have:
	  - high fibrinogen 
	  - high homocysteine
	  - elevated hsCRP
	  - high Lp(a)
	  this could represent a very dangerous combination for a heart attack or stroke

	- protective life labs Fibrinogen activity level 193 - 507 mg/dL
	- self decode 175 - 425 mg/dL
	- Calgary lab services 160 - 410 mg/dL hearthrive lab
	- Dr. Stephen Sinatra in his book "Reverse Heart Disease Now" 180 - 350 mg/dL
	- life extension wants to see under 300 mg/dL
	- Christian Wilde researched fibrinogen in depth and places fibrinogen among his 
	  top six measurements to check for heart disease prevention advocates under 280 md/dL
	  above 385 mg/dL is high risk
	- one stricter resource is Dr. Nadir Ali states optimum level under 235 mg/dL
	  above 350 mg/dL high risk
	- if you want to err on the strictt side consider this range to optimal: 280 mg/dL or less and up to 
	  320 mg/dL is acceptable

	- certain supplement could help improve your fibrinogen level include vitamin C, fish oil and nattokinase
	- more details on how these supplements can help prevent clotting in module 5 of hearthrive
}

9 - Lp(a) [Lipoprotein Little "a"]
{
	- a variation of LDL or low density lipoprotein
	- when this value elevated it may be associated with a higher risk of heart disease
	- some people are genetically predisposed to having high Lp(a).
	- you won't know unless you get it checked at least one time.

	- many heart attacks occur in arteries that have blockages of 50% or less
	- you've probably heard stories of a person that suffers a heart attack quite suddenly
	  with no symptoms.

	- well, what happens is they have a plaque, it ruptures and a clot forms
	- the clot blocks the artery and the person has a heart attack
	- if you have Lp(a), the likelihood of that happening is much higher
	- Lp(a) is a variation of LDL, it has anohter attached protein and it
	  associate with a higher risk of heart disease and stroke 
	- in module 3 of hearthrive you'll learn that cholesterol is transported in the blood 
	  via lipoprotein particles
}

10 - Ferritin [Iron Storage]
{
	- this is a protein that binds to iron and thereby reflectr how much iron is stored
	in tissues in your body
	- too much iron creates more free radicals and increase oxidative stress and heart disease risk.

	- ferritin is another test that may reflect inflammation and an increased risk for heart disease
	- ferritin is a protein in the body that binds to iron, therefore, the amount of ferritin in your
	  body test gives an indication of how much iron is stored in your body
	- too much iron in your tissues is associated with having more free radicals and 
	  oxidative stress, in other words, inflammation
	- inflammation can damage arteries and set the stage for heart disease
	- Dr. Levy claims that 
	  "Heart Disease is especially sensitive to the negative effects of excess iron"
	- on the other hand a 2009 article in BMC medical Genomics says
	  "iron metabolism is very involved in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions
	   but the iron serum ferritin is not well correlated to iron distribution in the heart"
	- ferritin can be infeluenced by genetics
	- in other word, certain genes migh predispose you to storing too much iron
	- there is a snp or mutation that can be detected with genetic testing that is associated
	  with hemochromatosis, in other words, excess iron
	- will talk about this more in HEARThrive module 10 on Genetics
	- there are various health factors that can raise ferritin and hence infer some
	  inflammation is happening in your body examples:
	    - liver disease
	    - excess sugar and wheat gluten
	    - thyroid problems
	    - smoking
	    - too much stress
	    - abdominal obesity
	    - genetic hemochromatosis
	- if you discovered that you have high ferritin, you may need to find a doctor who is 
	  very proficient in understanding not only ferritin but also iron levels and percent
	  saturation for which there are readily available blood tests as well

	- malcom preior to his heart bypass surgery he had 6 ferritin tests in 2010
	- his lowest value was 96 ug/L, his highest was 146 ug/L
	- his value on april 8 2016 one month prior to his bypass was 121 ug/L and 
	  their doctors and cardiologist consider his ferritin levels to be well within 
	  acceptable level
	- doctor keith Scott-Mumby recommends a value under 275 ug/L for me and
	  under 175 ug/L for women.
	- in the book " Reverse Heart Disease Now" Dr. Stephen Sintra quotes a
	  1992 finnish study that found men with ferritin above 200 had a twofold
	  risk of heart disease
	- Dr, Mercola, Thomas Levy and Morley Robbins all agree that truly optimal
	  ferritin values need to be much lower in range of 60 - 80 ug/L
	- Robbins actually advocates 20 - 50 ug/L

	- it is possible to bring very high ferritin levels down by donating blood
	- be careful if you/re taking na iron supplement or if your mul;tivitamin contains 
	  iron and yet you don't know what your ferritin level is
	- most people especially men and post-menopausal women don't need to take extra iron
	  which will be explained in module 5 of Hearthrive on supplements

How to Convert U.S mg/dL to 
international mmol/L

divide by 18

90 mg/dL / 18 = 5 mmol/L


------------------
what i am thinking now is that, Insulin shows you if your body is having resistance which if getting a bit high means you are eating a bit more of
carbs and sugar foods so i look at the C-Peptide to make sure that this insulin is really upnormal and not the base of that person's body.
then i look at the HbA1c to know how much sugar is loaded into these blood cells which means with all the food and exercises the person practiced,
he could load that much sugar into his cells 

Lipid Panel HDL & Triglycerides is an individual path where it makes you able to ignore LDL (bad cholesterol) and focus on the triglycerides fat in your 
liver that increased with the increase of sugar in your blood Homocysteine in your blood causing



--------------[shortcut]----------
when you eatt sugar and carbs your glucose increases which force hemoglobin to carry sugar with 
with the oxygen making it a history of how poor is your diet for 3 months which is the period 
before your hemoglobin revoks, your liver will produce more triglycerides fats mainly from carbs 
and HDL will decrease, with the increase of glucose your blood sugar your body will be resistant 
to the insulin of your pancreas making the insulin not able to lower your blood sugar thus no
use of the insulin, and having too much insulin circulating your blood is an indicator of so much
sugar in your blood. 

mean while in the liver hsCRP will be manufactured which could bebecause of the bad diet which means
your body is inflammating. 

at the same time the sugar and carb you have eaten will depletes B vitamins, Magnesium which will make
you deficient in Methylatiion nutritions which will increase Homocysteine exposing you to heart disease 
and more Homocysteine will lower thyroid function known as hypothyroidism 


another reason causes depletes Methylatiion nutritions is problems with your gut including dysbiosis and 
insufficient stomach acid could also result in more absorption of B vitamins and magnesium and thereby cause 
Homocysteine to increase

another reason causes depletes Methylatiion nutritions is you maybe genetically predisposed to have high Homocysteine. 
you may have certain genetic mutations that impair the ability to absorb vitamins and magnesium thereby resulting in high 
homocysteine

GERD Acid reflux, measles, mumps, tonsils removed
h.pylori is a bacteria that occurs in the stomach and can cause stomach distress and even ulcers
malcom had book about irritable bowel syndrome IBS after his brother surgery which 
is a problem he experienced many years

----------------------------
 Dr. Wiliam Davis  talks about in his book "Wheat Belly" including the proteins that are destructive to your gut leading to autoimmune 
problems that can provoke cardiovascular disease. these proteins could be the cause of intestinal premeability (leaky gut) which leaks 
particles that suppose not to be in your bloodstream and it will be attacked in process called autoimmunity. remember this your autoimmune 
condition can present for years long before you or your doctor notices something is wrong you might get a skin disease such as eczema and 
that is why NOW I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AUTOIMMUNITY because of the fact that i have eczema since i was young and also my grandfather
died with gut issues
------------------
 what i like in malcom and shows me that his knowledge is special is that he makes the thing that there is a baseline that a healthy person should be
 and our diseases are a deviation from that base. with the blood tests he gaves we will see instantly when we're away deviating from that baseline that 
 is helping us in the prevention from the first defense line. 

 what i also find interesting for me is that, I found his course when I was thinking and asking myself and wondering "Me as a person what is the thing that will 
 let me know I'm going not well before i Feel it ? what is the thing that in me that can reveal everything about me ? that has all my indicators" and i got this
 question from a concept in my proficient of Cybersecurity we have something called IoC or indicator of compromise which means in your computer, what small indicators
 that if you follow and found it exists, it indicates you've been compromised !the indicators will reveal what is the  computer virus
 that compromises you ( which later I found the Hippocrates slogan you shared with us in module 9 best fit this concept of IoC either in health or in computer science)


 and when i found malcom's course, I found it the answer! malcom's explain the X factor ! the one factor in your body that will reveal when you will get IoC ! it is your blood ! and that is what his tests will  reveal to you ... it is your Indicator of compromise
 that could be reflected in  your skin, or other indirect small matters that could be deceiptive to understand where is the real issue is !

 And I really understand the NOKAFS concept, when you feel something and doctors gave you the same medication they gave to thousands other than you where you
 feel he knows nothing .. and wonder "then who knows ?!" and you find it is really hard to find a doctor who can tell you the root causes of your issue, but
 no better than being your doctor ... taht is why I think Mr. Malcom's researches was out of these motivations which lead him to such knowledge and thus a terrific 
 course 

 the way i find malcom is special is that, true he doen't invented these tests or knnowledge, but as a researcher, he unlocked a full human chain by his
 way of understanding blood tests this way in a very logical and make sense way and also his motivation which is "Prevention" instead of reversing for example
 and the outcomes he is coming out with as a researcher from the books he reads, the experiences he went through (especially the fact that he is a twin of an opposite brother making their
 experience even double experience) I find it pretty pretty revelotional and can enable intelligent futuristic humans be the doctors of themselfs

 beside that, it is really astonishing for me Mr. Malcom is a person who logs everything before even he created this course ?! and before he has is triple heart 
 bypass surgary ?! which are a coincidences I'll rarely find in a born researcher and the reseaon I find it hard for someone to blame me such researcher with such
 very well oriented free course  is coming out of multiple coincidences that very rare happens to come out with thing which is for me is rare as well "the knowledge in HEARThrive"
 it how much it is rare is even reflected by its topics takes takes you in a journey or dramatic story from what you eat to your organs and bloodstreams to your genetics reaching your
 Jewellery ! your HEART

 that is why I hope he doesn't dy untill he totally finishes his course named HEARThrive ! which for me it is my baseline live diet untill i die and ask god his 
 that malcom's research helped me to take the best care of his creation and that is why god may let him live in heaven 

what I can say is that, before HEARThrive course, I would have never done a blood Test ! unless I need it the most ! where I would have already been fully compromised
by the disease .. NOW, I intentionally kick my ass to the nearest lab to do a blood test each 3 to 6 months and read it by myself, I will know where I'm going wrong
where I'm defiecient, where am I getting the root issues from, and not only that ! I also knows what genetics in my body that could makes me deficient and predisposed
to things normal person won't and what its concequences, so I'll catch up myself and add the needed vitamin/minerals to my diet in the perfect dosage !

I'm Happy with this skill I came out from him :)


I give you my greeting, and by the way I'm a dumpass twenny four years old and for anyy one in mu generation (generation Z) should see how the knowledge you share 
from your research should make generation Z even more intelligent and have more educated based decisions on their health wellness and make you as an iconic character :)
