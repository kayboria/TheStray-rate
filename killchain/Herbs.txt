Formulating 

If you want to make a tincture
for somebody, customized to their individual health
needs, you first need a formula.

Formulating process where you take
into account all of the knowledge and intuition you
have regarding herbs and their therapeutic actions, phytochemistry, biology,
pathology, your client's health from a holistic perspective,
as well as drug-herb interactions. You decide which herbs are going
to go into the formula proportions. It is both an art and a science.

Casual Chain
Real bad argument with you boss at work and you begin to worry
that you might get fired

What not to do - bad practice
- Stress Anxiolytic Pulsastilla
  - Insommnia Hypnotic California poppy 
    - Fatigue Adaptogen Ashwagandha
      - Weakened immunity Immunomodulator Astragalus
        - Viral infection antimicrobial Elder
          - Nasal congestion Goldenseal
          - Sore throat Demulcent(soothen the tissues)/antinfl/Analgesic he pick Demulcent Mullein
          - phlegm AntiCatarrahal Goldenrod
          - Cough Antitussive Coltsfoot
the problem when formulatting tincture you gonna wanna use five to seven herbs and
here we have nine herbs. the problem with this is in order to get therapeutic amount
of herbs you will need to take high dosages and that would be very cost prohibitive very
quickly so there is a better way
