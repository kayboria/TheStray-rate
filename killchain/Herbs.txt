  to help loosen it up.
> the third type is anthraquinones, which uses a chemical compound 
  called anthraquinone glycosides, which directly stimulate the

  could become reliant on them for peristalsis

- Cascara sagrada
- Rhubarb root
- Senna leaf
 
Lymphatic

> but when he refer to internal wounds he is talking 
  about physical wounds and not emotional wounds

- Arnica
- Comfrey
- Plantain



Formulating 

If you want to make a tincture
for somebody, customized to their individual health
needs, you first need a formula.

Formulating process where you take
into account all of the knowledge and intuition you
have regarding herbs and their therapeutic actions, phytochemistry, biology,
pathology, your client's health from a holistic perspective,
as well as drug-herb interactions. You decide which herbs are going
to go into the formula proportions. It is both an art and a science.

Casual Chain
Real bad argument with you boss at work and you begin to worry
that you might get fired

What not to do - bad practice
- Stress Anxiolytic Pulsastilla
  - Insommnia Hypnotic California poppy 
    - Fatigue Adaptogen Ashwagandha
      - Weakened immunity Immunomodulator Astragalus
        - Viral infection antimicrobial Elder
          - Nasal congestion Goldenseal
          - Sore throat Demulcent(soothen the tissues)/antinfl/Analgesic he pick Demulcent Mullein
          - phlegm AntiCatarrahal Goldenrod
          - Cough Antitussive Coltsfoot
the problem when formulatting tincture you gonna wanna use five to seven herbs and
here we have nine herbs. the problem with this is in order to get therapeutic amount
of herbs you will need to take high dosages and that would be very cost prohibitive very
quickly so there is a better way 



PHYTOCHEMISTRY

> what is phytochemistry? 
> the word phyto means plant. 
> So it simply means plant chemistry. And chemistry is a field of study
that examines the properties
> you do not need to be a chemist to be a great herbalist, but every herbalist should learn the basics of phytochemistry
> and there are numerous reasons for this One reason is because if you're creating a formula, you should know which chemical groups mix well together. > A second reason is because it will give you insight on how various phytochemicals interact with particular body systems. 
> And a third reason is because it will help you select the correct solvent to extract the phytochemicals that you require.


* Metabolites
> How do herbs work?
> Well, from a chemistry perspective,
there are substances called metabolites. And metabolites are basically chemicals
that allow the plant to metabolize. And there's two types of metabolites. 
> There's primary metabolites
and secondary metabolites.
> And if you're new to herbal
medicine, you might assume that plants work medicinally based on nutrition.
> And nutrition falls under
the category of primary metabolites. And there is some truth to that.
> There are quite a number
of medicinal herbs that are quite nutritious, and they definitely help
people recover through that mechanism.
> But primary metabolites
are more geared towards the essential functions of the plant.
> These are chemicals that facilitate things
like respiration, photosynthesis, the growth of the plant,
and all the other essential functions.
> But when we're talking about how plants
work medicinally, we're primarily We're talking about the secondary metabolites.
> Secondary metabolites are mostly
associated with defense. Defense against insects and animals,
defense against pathogens, other common diseases, defense against other plants.
> You might not know this,
but a lot of plants are in chemical war with each other. They'll send chemicals into the soil to
attack the competing plants around them that are not part of their same species.
> What else?
> They send chemicals out to attract
pollinating insects and animals. 
> This one's really interesting. Communicate between plant
and other friendly organisms. 
> So if an ash bore is invading a woodlot
and the ash trees on the outside are attacked first, they will send
chemical warnings to the trees further in to start ramping up their own chemical
defenses, their own immune system.
> So the majority of herbs we're talking
about that work medicinally use secondary metabolites. And so basically, these defenses
are chemicals that our bodies can actually use for themselves. 
> And so that's what we're going
to be focusing on in this section.

How Do Herbs "Work"?
Primary Metabolites       Secondary Metabolites
- provides the basis of   - Defend against insects and animals
nutrition in human diet   - Defend against plant pathogens
- Some medicinal herbs    - Defend against other plants
use primary metabolites   - Attract pollinating and seed dispersing animals
- Essential for survival  - Protection from ultraviolet light and oxidation
of the plant              - Communicate between plant and other friendly 
- Respiration               organisms
- Photosynthesis          - Majority of medicinal herbs use secondary 
- Growth, structure         metabolites
- All other essential
functions

* Compounds
> Before we go any further, I want to cover
some foundational concepts of chemistry.
> Before we go any further, I want to cover
some foundational concepts of chemistry.
> you're going to hear that all the time,
especially if you're into researching the chemistry aspect of herbal medicine.
> Compounds are basically
made of molecules, and molecules are made of two or more atoms.
> A great example of a
molecule would be H₂O.
> That stands for two
hydrogens and one oxygen.
> You should know this one as water.

* Atoms
> let's talk about atoms.
> The diagram at the top is a representation
of an oxygen atom,
> and the diagram at the bottom is
a representation of two hydrogen
> atoms bonded to an oxygen atom. And atoms are the basic units of matter.
> They're composed of protons,
neutrons, and electrons. If you look at the top diagram,
the red and yellow spheres represent the protons and neutrons,
which together make the nucleus.
> In orbiting around them,
the blue spheres are the electrons. And protons are positively charged,
electrons are negatively charged, and neutrons are neutrally charged.
> And the number of electrons on each
shell is determined by a certain pattern. 
> And the first shell will always
have two electrons on it.
> The second shell will always have eight,
and so on, according to the formula.
> Now, the outermost shell is called
the valent shell, and it wants to be full.
> And you can see that in the oxygen valent shell, there's only six electrons.
> And we know that according to the formula,
there could be eight electrons.
> So that's what's going to allow it to bond
to the two hydrogen atoms, because the hydrogen atom only has one electron.
> So when you add in the two hydrogen atoms,
it's adding in the two electrons, and that's going to satisfy the valence shell.


* Polarity
> As mentioned, electrons
have a negative charge.
> When atoms are bonded together
into a molecule, the negative charge of the electrons
affects the overall electrical charge of the molecule.
> When that electrical charge is unevenly
distributed, the molecule is said to be polar.
> Polarity is basically the value
of how polar a molecule is. 
> To recap, the electronegativity
of the atoms that make up the molecule determines its polarity.
> Let's take a look at our H₂O example.
> We have hydrogen atoms
donating electrons to our oxygen atom.
> The hydrogen atoms are going to become
less negative and more positive, and the oxygen atom is going to be
more negative and less positive.
> The difference in electrical charge
across the molecule causes its polarity.
>  Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond. The scale most commonly used to quantify electronegativity is the Pauling scale, developed by Linus Pauling.
> Oxygen has 8 protons in its nucleus, which strongly attracts electrons. The smaller size of oxygen compared to elements in lower periods also means that its valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and more tightly held, contributing to its higher electronegativity.
> Why Hydrogen is Less Electronegative:
Hydrogen has only 1 proton in its nucleus, so it does not have the same effective nuclear charge as oxygen.
Its electron configuration is 1s¹, and hydrogen can only hold two electrons in its first shell, meaning it has a lower tendency to attract electrons compared to oxygen.
> In short, the electrical charge difference across the water molecule (due to the unequal sharing of electrons between oxygen and hydrogen) creates a polar molecule, which means it has a positive end and a negative end. This polarity has profound effects on the behavior of water and contributes to its many special properties.

* Solubility
> Another concept solubility which is ability for a  substance to dissolve in a solvent
> Solvent: liquid substance capable of dissolving other substances
> so we used them for extracting chemical compunds from herbs
> The General principle: like dissolved like 
> practically speaking, High polarity solvents used to extract high polarity compunds
> and low polarity solvents used to extract low polarity compounds

solvent     Polarity
Water       1.000
Glycerol    0.812
(glycerin)
Ethanol     0.654
Acetic Acid 0.648
Acetone     0.355
Ethyl       0.228 
acetate
Diethyl     0.117
ether
Hexane      0.009
Olive oil   0.000

> The key takeaway here as a herbalist
is that you really want to make sure you're choosing the proper solvent
for the compounds in the herbs that you're trying to extract.
> Practically, what that means is you
may need to adjust the water content or the alcohol content according
to what you're trying to accomplish.


* Most Common Elements found in Medicinal Herbs
> first of all by elements here meant is atoms
> if you look in the periodic table of elements there is a hundred and eighteen elements listed 
> but in herbal medicine you are gonna find six of them occur over and over again
> and those are:
- Carbon
- Hydrogen
- Oxygen
- Nitrogen
- silver
- phosphur

* Major Categories of Compounds in Herbs
> there are seven major chemical compounds that are found in herbs
> the categories are broken down to:
- Carbohydrates
- Phenols
- Amino acids
- Lipids
- Terpenoids
- Steroids
- Alkaloids

* Carbohydrates
> Carbohydrates are broken down into several categories:
- Organic Acids
- Monosaccharides
- Disaccharides
- Oligosaccharides
- Polysaccharides
  - Homopolysaccharides
  - Heteropolysaccharides
    - Gums and Mucilages
    - Immunomodulating polysaccharides

* Gums and Mucilages
> Mucilages are slippery slimy substances which are natural a part of the plant
> while Gums areproduced in response to injury, insect attacks, infection
> Herbs:Flaxseed, chia seed, marshmallow, slippery elm, Acacia gum
> it is important to realize that this do not cure any conditions but they are very soothing so they'll be extremely helpful for inflammation.
> your gut digestive enzymes do not break them down
> although your gut flora will help decompose them, but basically, they're going to be great sources of fiber
> Mucalages and gums are extremely useful for treating GI tract disorders.
> Some examples are inflammation, lesions, ulcers, acid reflux, GERD, indigestion, diarrhea, and dyspepsia.

* Phenol
> The next category of compounds found in
herbs or phytochemicals is called phenols.
> phenols break down
into 18 subcategories.
> We're definitely not going
to cover all of them.
> But for the purpose of this page, I want
you to be familiar with three of them.
> But what are phenols?
> Phenols are compounds with one or more
alcohol groups attached to an aromatic ring.
> You can see in the diagram, the aromatic ring represented by the hexagon and the OH group attached alcohol group.
> in general, phenols are bacteriocidal, they're anthelmintic, and they are anesthetic.

- Phenolic acids                - Flavonoids
- Phenylpropandoids             - Hydrolyzable tannins
- Coumarins                     - Proanthocyanidins & condensed tannins
- Furanocoumarins               - Isoflavones (isoflavonoids)
- Lignans                       - Benzofurans
- Phenylpropanoid derivates     - Chromones
- Stilbenoids                   - Pholorglucinol derivatives
- Xanthones                     - Phenolic Resins
- Styrylpyrones                 - Quinones

* Flavonoids
> The first group of phenols I
want to talk about is flabinoids.
> Flabinoids decrease the permeability
and fragility of blood vessels in the capillary bed.
> That makes them very useful
for conditions like edema.
> Edema is basically swollen tissues.
> Some examples of flabinoid
would be rutin and quercetin.
> some examples of herbs that have
flabinoid would be
- Hawthorn
- Elder flowers
- Rue
> Now, there's a type
of Flavonoids called tannins.
> And tannins are basically
long chains of polymers, which means the molecule, the Flavonoids molecule,
is repeated over and over and over again, up to 50 different times.
>  they're known for their astringency,
which means they constrict tissues or they tighten them up.
> They're very prevalent
in anti-wrinkle creams.
> Some uses of tannins would be diarrhea,
pyrea, hemorrhoids, dermatitis, varicose veins, and poison ivy.
> A few herbal examples would be white oak
bark, bayberry, and agrimony.
> Tannins: Astringent. They forcee fluid from mucosal tissue

* Anthraquinones
> The next group of phenols
I want to discuss is anthraquinones.
> anthraquinones
are actually a subcategory belonging to the quinone class.
> Quinones are basically three-ring
hydrocarbon structures that have the quinone molecule in the center of them.
> And this arrangement of molecules tends to
cause colors of red, orange, and purple.
> So some examples of herbs that
have high anthraquinone content would be
- Rhubarb
- Aloe
- Senna
- Cascara sagrada
> the major action is a laxative effect.
> And it does this by
stimulating peristalsus, which basically means it causes direct contraction
of the peristalsus muscles in the colon to push out the stool.
> The obvious use for this
would be constipation.

* Phenolic Acids
> The final group of phenols I want
to talk about is phenolic acids.
> Phenolic acids are used
for their analgesic effect. That basically means they
reduce one's perception of pain.
> But it's important to note that it doesn't
actually mean they remove the root cause of pain.
> An example of a phenolic
acid would be salicin.
> A pharmaceutical example/version you might be
familiar with is acetylsalicylic acid.
> They can be used for chronic pain, but
they're not recommended for acute pain.
> The reason for that is because it takes
at least six hours to accumulate in the blood.
> Some herbal examples would be 
- meadowsweet
- white willow
- aspen
- poplar

* Lipids
> The next category
of phytochemicals are the lipids.
> lipids are divided into
- Fatty acids
  - Essential fatty acids
  - Saturated fatty acids
  - Unsaturated fatty acids
  - Trans fatty acids
- Triglycerides
- Waxes
- Alkamides
- Polyalkenes
- Phospholipids

> What are lipids?
> Well, technically,
lipids are composed of esters of long-chain fatty acids and alcohol
that include carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
> That just sounds confusing.
> What I want you to remember is they're
primarily either oils, fats, or waxes.
> What separates them usually is
their state at normal temperature.
> For example, the triglycerides,
which are oils, are liquid at normal temperature
> fats are solid at normal temperature
> and When it comes to waxes,
they're actually made of a combination of things, metal alcohol and fatty acids.
> Lipids are good for your entire body
structure, but the main thing I want you to remember is that they're good
for your brain and your heart.
> They can be found in roots and fruit,
but primarily, you're going to really see them in nuts and seeds. example
- Flaxseed
- hempseed
- chia seeds
- walnuts 
- etc
> A word of warning is about the trans fats. They are terrible for you.
> I'm sure you've heard it
a million times, but avoid them. They're primarily found in processed food.

Terpenoids
> our next category
of phytochemicals are the Terpenoids.
> Terpenoids are divided into
- Monoterpenes
- Diterpenes
- Triterpenes
- Tetraterpenes
- Sesquiterpenes
- Saponins
- Botanical steroids
- Essential oil and oleoresins

> Terpenoids are derived from five
carbon precursor isopreens, and that's a bit beyond the scope of this course.
> But basically, what I want you
to remember is that they produce strong aromas and odors.
> Terpenoids form the largest ingredient
in volatile oils, aka essential oils.
> So think of your essential oil diffuser
that makes your house smell good.
> So essential oils are antiseptic.
> They are irritating locally,
and that's why you don't apply them to skin without a carrier oil.
> And they're also systemically relaxing.
> So a few herbal examples
would be 
- peppermint
- cinnamon
- clove.
> And the essential oil
in peppermint is menthol.
> So some examples of what you could
use peppermint for would be to freshen your breath, to soothe smooth muscle,
which would help with intestinal spasms.
> Think of irritable bowel syndrome.
> You could use it to relax tight skeleton
muscles and help thin your mucus.

* Steroids
> The next category of phytochemicals are
the steroids
> but we're going to focus on a subcategory called cardiac glycosides.
> cardiac glycosides
are specific for the function and rhythm of the heart muscle.
> cardiac glycosides
increase the force of myocardial contractions, your heart pumping.
> Now, this has the effect of decreasing
your heart rate and the conductivity. 
> The pharmaceutical industry actually
uses a cardiac glycoside called Digitalis
> that comes from the herb foxglove
> foxglove is quite toxic,
and so it's usually banned.
> But cardiac glycosides can be found in
other herbs, and some examples would be
- Pleurisy root
- Figwort
- Lily-of-the-valley

* Alkaloids
> The final category
of phytochemicals are the alkaloids.
> alkaloids are divided into seven
subcategories, but we're not going to focus on any particular subcategory.
> What are alkaloids?
> alkaloids are molecules
that contain at least one nitrogen atom. 
> And alkaloids are the most potent
medicinal category of all the phytochemicals.
> And they're used extensively
in pharmaceuticals, for example,
- morphine
- ephedra
> Alkaloids are not very water-soluble.
> So when you're making tinctures,
you want to make sure you're using ethanol as your solvent.
> ow, herbs that have a high concentration
of alkaloids can be quite toxic.
> And normally, you just vomit them up,
but you want to take extra care for children and the elderly.
> For example, one of my favorite
herbs is common comfrey.
> But there are some species of comfrey,
such as Russian comfrey and prickly comfrey, where the alkaloid levels
are just too toxic no matter the age.
> Now, even with common comfrey,
which is used for broken bones, cuts, and burns, there are pyralisidine
alkaloids that can harm the liver.
> But these are in the young
leaves and young roots.
> Nevertheless, it is a controversial herb,
so if you're going to use it, make sure you do your research first.
