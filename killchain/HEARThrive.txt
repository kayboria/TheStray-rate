Blood Tests to avoid heart disease

Causes of Heart Disease:
- Insulin Resistance syndrome [Metabolic Syndrome]
- Inflamation


Insulin Resistance syndrome 

{
	[
		when we eat sweet desserts that are high in sugar/carbs such as rice, potatos, breads our blood sugar
		rises. pancreas increases the hormone insulin to manage your blood sugar. So too much sugar and too much
		insulin puts you at risk of heart disease 
	]

	[	if you have high blood sugar you should be worried.
		- it is your ticket toward diabetes and heart diseases.
		- diabetes can lead to serious health complications.
		- including amputation to your legs, kidney failure
		  and blidness and it could knock 8 years off your life.
	]

	[these are five tests that will help you aassess your heart disease risk from the perspective of sugar and insulin]

	1 - Fasting Glucose [fasting blood sugar]
	{
		- this test measuers the glucose level in your blood after not eating any food for at lease 10 hrs

		- everyone has some sugar circulating in their blood.
		- the fasting glucose test measures how much sugar is present after not eating at least 10 hrs
		  preferably 12 hrs
		- the average person has about 5 liters of blood in their body (5 cartons of 1 liter milk)
		- there should be 1 tsp/ 4 gram sugar in the 5 cartons of blood
		- to know how sensitive your body is ....
		    - 4g sugar = 85 mg/dL
		    - 10g sugar = 200 mg/dL (Diabetes)
		- healthier goal is to consume no more than 15 net grams of carbs per meal
		- when you calculate the carbs, minus Fibres from carbs to get net grams of carbs
		- you can be sure your blood sugar would spike like crazy after eating high glycemic carb food like paste
		- avoid eating eggs that are mass-produced in a factory farm or CAFO (concentrated animal food operation)
		- The American Heart Association says that the amount of added sugar you should eat in a day are 
		  - for men 37.5 or 9 teaspoons of sugar
		  - for women 25 g or about 6 teaspoons of sugar
		- wheat-based products convert quickly to sugar in your body that poses a cardiovascular
		  risk that most people fail to recognize
		- throughout the HEARThrive program you will hearing a lot more about wheat and why
		  it must be avoided
		- particular food might be causing your blood sugar to rise excessively after you eat, you should 
		  always keep your blood sugar well controlled to help avoid heart disease, much more demo of this in 
		  module 6 on Diagnostic procedure
		- eating large potato and waiting for 45 minutes your blood sugar will respond to up to 130 mg/dL
		- ideally, your blood sugar should remain under 100 after eating which you can achieve if you can
		  avoid high glycemic foods
		- module 8 of hearthrive show you how popcorn is bad for your blood sugar and considered as 
		  high glycemic food which makes it causing heart disease you can check that by eating popcorn
		  and check your blood sugar after 30 - 6- minutes after that 
		- avoid food that spikes your blood sugar
		- if you always get fasting blood sugar values above 110 mg/dL that is indicative of prediabtetes
		- if the fasting blood sugar is consistently above 126 mg/dL that suggests you have diabetes
		- don't hang your hat on just one blood test measure, ideally you should track your value over time
		- test your own blood sugar at home using glucometer before and after meals
		- when you wake up in the morning a hormone called "Cortisol" rises. this is a normal  response and it often
		  causes your blood sugar to increase a bit.
		- this is a normal called "Dawn Effect or Dawn Phenomenon"
		- wait a bit after getting out of bed and don't eat anything for hour or two before testing
		  your morning fasting glucose
		- some people g et nervous when they undergo blood testing. If you/re anxious it's possible 
		  your blood sugar will rise with stress.
		- another thing to be aware of that you can get quite nice fasting blood sugar values, and yet
		  they won't reveal that you on the way to becoming metabolically unhealthy, that is because
		  your insulin, which helps normalize blood sugar, is functioning well enough to keep your blood
		  sugar in a healthy range. but your body maybe using more and more insulin to accomplish this.
		  that is not a healthy situation. and that is why you have to look at a number of blood tests 
		  to get atruly reliable picture.
		- a key test to include is fasting insulin which doctors fail to test
		- go to the fasting insulin section to get better understanding of this very important marker
		- if you are eating a low glycemic breakfast Dr. Wiliam Davis says you want to see very little change
		  in your blood glucose after you've had your meal. He says retest your blood sugar
		  about 30 to 60 minutes after you started to eat like malcom got his glucose 85 to 86 mg/dL 
		  after eating. he took his dog for a walk for 40 minutes and the glucose dropped to 72 mg/dL
		
		- optimal value of 85 mg/dL (80 - 90 mg/dL)
		- HeartHrive tested his fasting blood golucose after 2 hrs of waking up to be
		  85 mg/dL with blood pressure 122/76 mmHg systolic over diastolic  with pulse at 82 bpm
	} 

	2 - Hemoglobin A1C [HbA1c]
	{
		- this test assesses your average blood sugar control over 3-months period.
		- can show whether a person is becoming diabetic which has major association with heart disease.

		- if you are concerned that you're aging faster than you'd like, you're going to really want 
		  to pay attention to this section on Hemoglobin A1c
		- did you know that sugar in your blood adheres to a protein in your blood called hemoglobin?
		- this process known as glycation, and the damage it casues can be measured with a Hemoglobin A1c test
		- Dr. Mark Houston explains more accurately that
		    "HbA1c shows how much blood glucose has been adhering to the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin
		    molecules in your red blood cells... over a period of time" 
		- because red blood cells survive approximately 3 months, Hemoglobin A1c measurement can tell  
		  you how much blood glucose has been sticking to your red blood cells in that period of time
		- if your hemoglobin A1c is high, it reflects that your blood glucose has been elevated for alot of
		  the time leading up to that test.
		- this occurs when you eat a poor diet with too much sugar, especially high fructose corn syrup found
		  in soda and high sugar fruit juices. also too many carbs , especially wheat and grain products such as bread
		  oatmeal, corn, rice and so on. as well as eating too often and not exercising.
		- when your hemoglobin A1c is high which again, means that your red blood cells are like "sugar coated"
		- that is very destructive for your body, you will be at an increased risk for heart disease from damage to the
		  endothelium in your arteries
		- you may age poorly, suffer with arthiris, eye issues including cataracts, glaucoma and even blindness,
		  kidney dysfunction/failure, Digestive problems, poor sleep, nerve problems/Peripheral neuropathy,
		  brain diseases including Alzheimer's/parkinson's
		- Dr Bret Scher - showed a higher risk of subclinical atherosclerosis [the buildup of plaque], even in people
		  with Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 or 5.6, that is why Dr. William Davis and Dr. Russel Jaffe recommend HbA1c under 5.0 ideal
		- caution: since Hemoglobin A1c measurement reflects more or less your average blood glucose over the last 3 months
		  we run into that same problem that we had with fasting glucose
		- you could have a good-looking fasting glucose level, but it could be misleading if we fail to look insulin
		  Insulin helps bring blood sugarunder control, but the key question is How much insulin is needed to achive this ?
		- a person whose pancreas crancking out lots of insulin to control blood sugar is not metabolically healthy.
		- this person may have fasting blood sugar and HbA1c in the normal range eve4ry time the doctor tests them.
		  and those values may continue to appear normal for many yearts thanks to their insulin production, but if 
		  the doctor isn't measuring the insulin there is no way of knowing whether thhe insulin being produced is well
		  above a healthy range.


		- the HbA1c measurement is a percent. an optimal healthy value is 5% or lower, and maybe slightly above
		  5%.
		- HbA1c under 5.6 is optimal
		- range 5.7 - 6.4 is a Borderline and suggestive of prediabetes
		- above 6.4 is a High riskand suggest you have diabetes.

	}

	3 - Fasting Insulin
	{
		- Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancrease to help you manage your blood sugar.
		- High values could indicate you are on your way to deveolping diabetes.

		- insulin is a hormone that manages the glucose in your blood by helping to move the 
		  sugar into your cells including fat cells, muscles and the liver. when this process
		  is working well not much insulin is required.
		- unfortunately, in many cases, as time goes on, more and more insulin is required to control
		  your blood sugar.
		- this means your cells are "less accepting" of the help insulin is offering. they are getting
		  resistant to the action of insulin. this is known as insulin resistance.
		- the scary thing is that you cloud have perfectly normal blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c
		  for 10 to 15 years while your insulin has already been raging  out of control all that time
		- what is overlooked is how much insulin is being called upon to control your blood sugar
		- you and your doctor will never know unless you do a fasting insulin test
		- your insulin may still be doing its job ... but lurking below the radar so to speak
		- so why you want to test your fasting insulin while your blood glucose and HbA1c are in an
		  optimal level ? 
		  "say I want to see if my insulin is achieving its goal while remaing at an optimal level" 
		  "if my fasting insulin level came in high, then it would mean my metabolic system is 
		  dysfunctional and that I likely have insulin resistance."
		- if a healthy person fasted for 12 hrs and then got a blood test to check their insulion level,
		  it would be low.
		- after all, if you have't eaten anything for 12 hrs, why would there be much insulin
		  circulating in your body if you're metabolically healthy person ?
		- but if you've wrecked the functions that should naturally be working.., and your blood cells
		  are overloaded with sugar from overconsumption of sugar and high glycemic carbs, and have
		  developed insulin resistance, it's very possible that even after fasting, your insulin level 
		  will be high
		- you have twofold risk of developing diabetes if your fasting insulin is 8 uIU/ml versus
		  5 uIU/ml.



		- an optimal level would be under 4 uIU/ml
	}

	4 - C-Peptide
	{
		- this test also relates t o insulin resistance [Hyperinsulinemia]. 
		- together with fasting insulin, you can learn whether you're on the path to diabetes
		- these tests can tell you about the danger much sooner than the Hemoglobin A1c.

		- C-peptide is associated with insulin and can help determine how well your pancreas is working
		- the beta cells in your pancreas are involved with the production of insulin, and C-Peptide can help
		  determine how well those beta cells are wokring.
		- for every molecule of C-peptide, there is one molecule of insulin, so if your C-peptide is high
		  your body or your pancreas is probably lots of insulin means your body having insulin resistance,
		  means you are eating carbs food.
		- if your C-Peptide value falls below the recommended reference range, that could mean you have Type I
		  diabetes and that your pancreas is producing no insulin
		- or, you might have Type II diabetes that has gotten to the stage where your pancreas and beta cells are 
		  now functioning very poorly and failing to produce much insulin


		- a normal C-peptide blood test which by the way should be done fasting for 12 hrs is 0.5 - 2.0 ng/ml
		- self decode lab uses 0.8 - 2.26 ng/ml
		- Boston Heart Lab uses 1.4 - 3.3 ng/ml

	}

	5 - Lipid Panel HDL & Triglycerides
	{
		- this is the typical cholesterol panel which includes HDL & Triglycerides
		- ignore most of the cholesterol values and only pay attention on HDL & Triglyceride values
		- Low DHL combined with high Triglycerides associated with insulin resistance.

		- Triglycerides are fats in your blood, but they're manufactured in the liver mainly from carbs
		- in other words, excess sugar and starchy carbs consumption (not fats consumed) cause triglycerides to increase
		- if you have high triglycerides and low HDL. .. Look out! that is a bad combination suggestive of insulin resistance
		  instead you need your triglycerides to be low and HDL to be high
		- most doctors and cariologists worry about high cholesterol and the key in on LDL cholesterol so called "bad cholesterol"
		- LDL can be lowered dramatically with statin medication
		- doctor love when they make a difference using medication
		- the problem with targeting LDL is that your attention taken off much more critical factors taht influence heart disease
		- Dr. Robert Lusting has an abysmal view of LDL, in a YouTube video he said 
		   - "... Looking at an LDL number and saying you're in good shape or not is garbage, useless, worse than useless
		   in fact detrimental."
		- so let;s forget about looking at LDL and total cholesterol number and instead we will focus more on
		  triglycerides and HDL because they are much more directly linked to your metabolic health and risk of heart disease

		- Many experts today says we don't have to worry about saturated fat and butter negatively
		  affecting our heart health, but that could be an oversimplification because some people
		  who carry certain genes might have to minimize dietary saturated fat and this will be
		  explained in hearthrive module 10 on genetics


		- an optimal number for triglycerides according to Dr. William Davis and other experts is
		  60 mg/dL or less
		- 150 mg/dL is way too high
		- optimal level of HDL is 60 mg/dL or higher


		- there are ways to lower triglycerides and raise HDL that don't require any medication
		- eliminate/drastically reduce your consumption of refined foods, starchy carbs, sugar and trans fats
		- ignore mainstream dietary advice that tells you to cutyour fat and cholesterol intake from food and
		  to eat lots of so-called healthy whole grains.
		- if you start eating more healthy fats than carbs, you are gonna see improvements in your metabolic health
		  and that translates into lower risk of heart disease
		- you will see more about that in the diet of HeartThrive
		- your triglycerides will go down and your HDL will go up, you will loss wait
		- keep in mind that your lipid number especially triglycerides and HDL could bethrown off somewhat if you get 
		  tested while you losing weight.
		- Dr. William Davis explains that when you lose weight fat is mobilized and your lipid numbers may rise as a result
		- in these circumstancees, doctors often tell their patients "you are doing everything wrong", you are going to have to find a doctor 
		  who's knowledgeable in low carb physiology
		- in HeartThrive module three on statins and cholesterol you are going to learn that cholesterol
		  is transported via lipoprotein particles in your blood
		- these particles can be measured using special blood tests, and they're a much better predictor of heart disease
		  than standard cholesterol values but if you have low triglycerides and high HDL there is a very good chance your
		  lipoprotein particle measurements will be favorable, more on that on module 3

		---------------


		- Hearthrive after triple bypass heartt surgery in may of 2016 they told him to take 
		  quite a lot of medications. some temporarilya and others to be taken the rest of his life
		- of course one of the prescriptions was for atorvastatin commonly knowns as Lipitor
		  designed to lower cholesterol and put him in the maximum dose 80 mg per 
		- he stopped after one week and said "I don't wanna take this SHIT (Statin High Intensity Therapy)"
		- calcium high scores to 479 is high and suggestive of atherosclerosis (i.e heart disease)
		- more about calcium scores in Hearthrive module 6
		- in "Wheat Belly Total Health" Dr. Davis gives several non drug strategies to improve cholesterol and
		  the more important (in his opinion) liporpotein numbers.
		- his approach begins with diet eliminating wheat and grains (including rye, oats, corn, ricee etc
		- as an added bonus, this is often accompanied by weight loss.
		- Dr. Davis recommends taking a few important supplements particularily vitamin D and fish oil
		- proper thyroid function is critical and Dr.Davis addresses this too
		- and beccause intestinal permeability leads to autoimmune dysfunction which in turn contributes
		  to or even causes heart disease
		- Dr. Davis explained how to optimize gut flora with probiotics and prebiotics
		- * what is a good LDL value ? a cardiologist oncee told hearthrive the only thing that matters 
		  when it comes to heart disease prevention is lowering your LDL cholesterol, he said the goal 
		  would be for me to bring Hearthrive LDL down to 70 mg/dL
		- that's the guieline for people with known heart disease like hearthrive.
		- often hearthrive read that if you don't have known heart disease, an LDL level of 100
		  is acceptable 
		- hearhrive standard reference range that shows in his result sheet when getting
		  blood work done is to keep LDL under 139
		- he got LDL level of 99 mg/dL
		- spectracell uses 40 to 130
		- website Lab Test Analyzer suggests that an optimal LDL should range 80 to 160
		- most doctors seeing an LDL above 200 would be shocked
		- world renowned lipidologist Dr. Thomas Dayspring mentioned in a YouTube video that an LDL
		  value over 200 is where he would get concerned 
		- Dr. Aseem Malhotra was interviewd by Dr. Mark Hyman in a podcast Dr. Malhotra explained
		  that William Castelli one of the co-directors of Framingham looked back the data
		  and in 1996 published a paper in Atherosclerosis stating the data showed that unless the 
		  LDL was above 300 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) that it was essentially useless as a biomarker for predicting heart
		  disease
		- WITH SUCH A HUGE RANGE OF WAHT A HEALTHY LEVEL OF LDL SHOULD BE IT'S NO WONDER THE
		  AVERAGE PATIENT WOULD BE CONFUSED
		- or it is possible as Dr. William Davis suggests that LDL is among the worst
		  markers to look at for cardiovascular risk
		- and yet it's the value your doctor will show you as his reason for putting yopu
		  on a statin drug
		- a drug that will almost invariably provide no cardiovascular risk benefit
		- making Hearthrive comes to the invetible conclusion that when it conmes 
		  to LDL,statins and heart disease No One Knows Anything For Sure (NOKAFS)
		- Dr. Davis is a cardiologist the author of "Wheat Belly and "undoctored" offers a number of
		  key health strategies to help reduce your heart disease risk.
		- most cardiologists would tell you to take a statin drug to lower your cholesterol
		  but not Dr. Davis who  says 
		  "you will learn that of all the steps you can take to gain control over coronary risk
		   the statin drug is the last on the list and of questionable or minimal benefits"
		- Dr Davis says the opposite about LDL role in heart disease:
		  "There is no longer any lingering doubt Lipoprotein assessments are substantially
		   superior to cholesterol assessments"
		- in 2014 malcom started started pretty good then the LDL particles got pretty high but luckily
		  it was large LDL which cholesterol
		- we come down to the small density particles  LDL three and four come int o a healthier range
		- he also got a little bit geting into yellow area that is because he had not an optimal
		  level of HDL of 45 mg/dL 
		- myron his brother eats high carbs so he start with much higher VLDL which correlates to having
		  higher triglycerides
		- the statin drugs myron takes brought his large LDL significantly lower than malcom
		- however the statin drugs doesn't help his HDL which was 35 mg/dL compared to his brother 
		  45 mg/dL
		- * similarily because of myron high carb diet his VLDL his significantly high than malcom
		  which the statins can't help. and high VLDL means having high triglycerides as well as lower HDL
		- and high triglyceride with lowe HDL is a potential indicator for insulin resistance
		- malcom have met with 5 cardiologists since his identical twin brother had
		  his quadruple heart bypass surgery in 2008 and they all basically say the same thing
		- they put the pressure on they tell you, you got to take aspirin, a beta blocker
		  and cholesterol lowering statin drugs.
		- one of the cardiologists he met in 2012 and turned out he was one of the very'
		  highly regarded cardiologist in his city
		- always remember the graphs he should to you in module 3 episode "comparing our cholesterol and lipoprotein values"
		- remember the three peeks the VLDL the cholesterol the HDL and the hidden things it tells like
		- when the VLDL (at the beginning of the chart) is high means the triglyceride is high means the HDL
		  is low which you will see at the end of the graph where you should see the line going low when the 
		  line at the start of the graph for VLDL is high
		- and also people who take statins get cholesterol (the middle peak) to be low because it is managed 
		- he prepared for the meeting. he went through blood tests, previous test results, thoughts in order
		  questions linedup
		- the things happened that doctor told him he need to take statins he refused the  doctor told him
		  he won't accept him as a patient
		- malcolm was chatting with us and saying this story in 3 march 2016 and he know that he has quite 
		  high calcium score of 479 which could cause heart disease
		- he was also saying that he has the confidence and the knowledge to avoid the 
		  booby trap beecause of everything he does in HEARThrive like Diet Exercise
		  stress sleep hormones gut and much more
		- after the video by 2 months he got tripple heart bypass 
		- after the operation he asked the surgeon that operated on him this question
		  "if he had listened to that cardiologist in 2012 who told him to take a statin,
		   baby aspirin and a beta blocker, could he have prevented needing this triple bypass?"
		- the surgeon replied "it would have happened anyway, there is a genetic predisposition in your family
		  to have coronary disease"
		- so if it would happen anyway, why the heck would he take 
		  - statin to lower cholesterol
		  - aspirin to thin his blood 
		  - beta blocker to relax his heart and lower blood pressure
		- since 2010 he knew he had a significant heart disease not to mention his identical brother
		  twin brother needing quadruple bypass in 2008
		- he says if regardless of what he did the end result wast hat he was ultimately going 
		  to need heart surgerry then in the end he is glad he followed the principle of HEARThrive 
		  just follwoing more natural approach rather then taking statins and medications
		- in 2008 after malcom's brother got quadruple heart bypass surgery malcom's plan was 
		  to get started on a cardiac workup as soon as possible and getting educated about heart
		  disease himself
		- in june 9th 2008 he went to the bookstore and picked up several books taht were related 
		  to heart and one on IBS
		- books that influenced his eating diet was from Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn entitled prevent
		  and reverse heart disease which was very much oriented toward eating a diet designed
		  to keep fat and oil completely out of your diet if you want to achieve heart health
		  as well as plant based
		- the second thing that influenced the way he was going to eat was after he had seen
		  a cardiologist in june 2008 and gave him a sheet on the dash diet
		- the dash diet is designed to help with hypertension but also a diet that minimize fats and
		  focuses more on the idea of eating fruites and grains and vegetables and lean meat.
		- he was suffering from IBS and bought a book entitled "IBS relief" on june 9th 2008
		- that book became the third thing that influenced his diet and changed how he ate
		- the kind of takeaways he had from that book that would be following with his diet to
		  help alleviate IBS included for example eating a diet that had a lot of fiber, whole wheat crackers
		  wheat bran muffins,ceral, whole wheat bread and so on
		- steered clear of fat and even protein to some extent and focues more on fiber and carbs
		- he was excited with his eating plan and noted it is going to be heart healthy as well
		- you should know by know if that was true !
		- malcom was logging all what he eat since he bought the books with the new diet that has 
		  no fats and focuses on carbs from may 2008 untill he made the cholesterol test in november 2008
		- when malcom revised back he knew what he diet-related mistrakes that lead him to heart bypass despite
		  eating in a way that his cholesterol values were quite low he ended up with heart disease
		  - he belived it was bad to consume fat
		  - as a result his diet was much too high in carbs and sugar due to fat avoidance
		  - he ate way too much fruit which means way too much sugar
		  - he was eating too frequently throughout the day with lots of snacking between
		    meals
		  - he was eating too close to bedtime and often that would be a snack far too
		    high in carbs and sugar such as cereal or fuit like a banana
		- his twin brother underwent a quadruple bypass in may 2008
		- after he was keeping up with this diet of high carbs for 6 months from may - november 2008
		  he did cholesterol test, his cholesterol was 166 mg/dL which is below 200 mg/dL and considered
		  to be normal.
		- LDL or bad cholesterol 111 mg/dL within the reference range as well
		- but the more important factor triglycerides and HDL. when you eatt too much
		  carbs your triglycerides get elevated.
		- his triglyceride was 119.5 mg/dL (damn!)
		- his HDL of 31.6 mg/dL (damn!)
		- you dontt want to have triglyceride to HDL ratio
		- in his case 119.5/31.6 mg/dL = 3.78
		- a better target is 2 or less preferably 1
		- let's see his blood workouot after 12 year, 2018 2019 2020, the opposite diet
		  of 2008 avoiding carbs minimize fruits eating primary fat and protein
		- eat less frequenlty throught the day
		- results 24 january 2020
		- cholesterol 360 mg/dL
		- HDL 69.9 mg/dL
		- Triglyceride 70.8 mg/dL 
		- the interesting thing is that it's possible this cholesterol profile as high as it looks
		  with those numbers is actually healthier cholesterol proile than the one had back on nobember
		  5th 2008
		- the way it can be illustrated is very simply that the triglyceride to HDL ratio which is 
		  close t to 1.01
		- what he said above is controversial and need more research
		- but at the bare minimum a man should have an HDL of at least 40 and preferably 50 and Davis encopurages 
		  60 or above AND HE REACHED 70 in 2020
		- Dave Feldman is a cholesterol geek who has done exceptional research and experimentation on
		  cholesterol and created calculator that will give you an idea based on three different studeies
		  what your cardiovascular risk is 
		- when he put his 2008 results in the calculator it indicated a higher risk of cardiovascular 
		  hard disease which he got in 2016
		- while his results from 2020 got all low (damn! nice!)
		- eating grains and fiber and fuit while avoiding fat proven to be a mistake
		- not only did it fail to improve his IBS but it also contributed to develop heart disease
		- as mentioned he was consuming exceed sugar and carb, that would cause his blood sugar to rise which in
		  turn causes glycation

Inflamation

[hidden inflamation that you are not aware of, but can be really deadly]
[think of the word inflammation as the word healing]
[
	- there's another type of hidden inflammation that goes on in your body as well, it is called chronic inflammation
	you're damaging yourself and perhaps killing yourself without even knowing that it's happening 
]
[
	- these test going to help you detect whether inflammation is happening in your body and once again, think of that as
	  healing happening in your body
	- the  key questions to ask yourself are why is this healing happening and why is it necessary ?
	- I must have done something wrong or I'm doing something wrong that's cauing my body to have to keep healing 
	  itself all the time
	- this will make it a lot easier to understand what these blood tests mean
	- they address chronic inflammation, or chronic healing - healing that has to keep happening because something's 
	  wrong in your body
]


6 - hsCRP [high sensitive C-Reactive Protein]
{
	- this test measures high sensitive C-Reactive Protein is related to inflamation in your body
	and an increased risk of heart disease

	- this protein is manufacctured in your liver when there is inflammation in your body.
	- although there is a standard test called CRP, it's important that you request hsCRP when evaluating
	  your heart disease risk
	- there are many other inflammatory conditions that can raise hsCRP, therefore, it's not an absolute risk marker
	  for heart disease but something worth tracking
	- you could have an infection or inflammation in your body that you may or may not even know of and sure
	  enough your hsCRP will be elevated
	- other inflammatory conditions that might raise hsCRP include:
	  - arthritis flare-up
	  - urinary tract infection
	  - gum disease
	  - poor sleep before the test
	  - having big belly with lots of abdominal fat
	- other serious health conditions that could produce a high hsCRP number include:
	  - crohn's disease
	  - ulcerative colitis
	    - diabetes
	  - high blood pressure etc.
	- hsCRP is an inexpensive routin blood test so I encourage you to ask your doctor to run for you every year
	  maybe every six months


	- under 1.0 mg/L (or 0.5) low risk
	- some experts in fact prefer 0.5 or less
	- from 1.0 - 3.0 average - Borderline
	- above 3.0 increased risk


	- keep your hsCRP at a healthy level
	- Dr. william Davis of course suggests we avoid wheat, grains, expecially those containing glutens and
	  sugar that are known to provoke inflammation
	- Tim Burmaster suggest we avoid sugar and alcohol and processed food and maintain a healthy omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in our diet
	- other suggestion include managing stress and getting proper sleep which will cover in heartthrive module 11
	- avoid environmental allergens and toxins which will be in hearthrive module 12 
	- certain supplement that could help support a healthy hsCRP value include:
	  - magnesium Glycinate
	  - vitamin K&D 120 mcg and 1000 IU
	  - CoQ10
	  - oil fish

7- Homocysteine
{
	- this is an amino acid, which if elevated may cause damage to coronary arteries 
	and increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke

	- Dr. Al Sears says you can think of Homocysteine as being like car exhaust from a running engine 
	- it's an amino acid that is produced naturally in your body as a byproduct of metabolism
	- in other words, it's like a toxic waste product that your cells dump into your bloodstream as they burn energy
	- Dr. Mark Houston writes
	  "... Too much Homocysteine alters the environment inside the arteries and sets the stage for arterial disease."
	- Christine Wilde who has studied heart disease extensively says
	   "... Homocysteine is associated with adverse 
	   - Platelet Aggregation
	   - Oxidation of LDL
	   - provoking the formation of plaque formation
	   "
	- in other words, high Homocysteine is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke
	- some studies suggest that  high homocysteine may be related to having low thyroid 
	  function, known as hypothyroidism
	- checking your thyroid get these 6 key blood tests
	  - TSH undoctored target 0.2 - 1.5 mIU/L
	  - Free T3
	  - Free T4
	  - Reverse T3
	  - Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody
	  - Thyroglobulin Antibody
	- more about how to solve thyroid problems in module 12 of HEARThrive
	- Myron has TSH of 4.5 Malcolm 2.0 
	- Myron's Thyroid abtibodies can tell he has Hashimoto's (elevated antibodies)
	- his thyroid ultrasound reveals a rough textured appearance indicative of a diseased thyroid
	- he has thyroid nodules
	- Malcolms has non
	- Malcolms takes iodine supplement as per undoctored inner circle advice
	- people who have high Lp(a) have it's combined with Homocysteine, even a greater risk of 
	  heart disease



	- Dr. Mark Houston explains levels above 6.0 umol/L could be problematic 
	- levels above 12.0 umol/L severe risk
	- Dr. David Jockers likes to see Homocysteine under 8.0 umol/L
	- Dr. Al Sears says value above 10.4 umol/L is abnormally high
	- and advices aiming below 7.0 umol/L
	- hearthrive advocates an optimal level between 6-7 umol/L
	- and acceptable range is 7 - 9


	- it is possile to lower Homocysteine 
	- first, you must understand that there is a biochemical preocess called methylation
	  going on in your body thousands of times a day
	- Methylatiion requires certain nutrients such as folate, vitamin B6 and B12 and others
	  including magnesium, zinc and trimethylglycine (TMG)
	- if these nutrients deficient, Homocysteine rises
	- poort diet high in sugar and carbs depletes B vitamins and magnesium and can cause 
	  Homocysteine to rise
	- problems with your gut including dysbiosis and insufficient stomach acid could also result 
	  in more absorption of B vitamins and magnesium and thereby cause Homocysteine to increase
	- more about gut health in module 9 of HEARTHrive
	- you maybe genetically predisposed to have high Homocysteine. you may have certain genetic 
	  mutations that impair the ability to absorb vitamins and magnesium thereby resulting in high 
	  homocysteine
	- hearthrive module 10 on Genetics
	- although high Homocysteine associated wikth increased cardiovascular risk, some experts say
	  there are studies where lowering it with supplements has not been shown to lower that risk
	 - it is possible in these studies that they weren't lowering Homocysteine enough to be helpful
	 - for example if the people going in had Homocysteine levels of let's say 14 umol/L reduced by
	   25% = 10.5 umol/L which 25% sound pretty good, but that may nopt be low enough to do any good 
}

8 - Fibrinogen
{
	- this is a blood protein associated with blood clotting and the formation of arterial plaque.

	- did you know you could have a heart attack and possibly die when plaque ruptures and a clot forms ?
	  and this could happen in a very critical artery in your heart and the scary thing is, this could happen
	  in a matter of minutes
	- so get ready to pay attention to fibrinogen, which has to do with clotting 
	- Fibrinogen is a blood protein made in the liver, it is involved with blood clotting and formation
	  of arterial plaque
	- it is also associated with the stickiness and viscosity of your blood
	- Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby explained that 
	  "... Fibrinogen is the precursor molecule that changes into fibrin when the blood clots"
	- in other word, high levels of Fibrinogen pose a greater heart disease risk for you
	- Dr Malcolm kendrick places Fibrinogen high on his list of cardiovascular risk factors
	- life extension says high homocysteine goes hand-in-hand with high fibrinogen, because 
	  having high homocysteine prevents the breakdown of fibrinogen
	- if you have:
	  - high fibrinogen 
	  - high homocysteine
	  - elevated hsCRP
	  - high Lp(a)
	  this could represent a very dangerous combination for a heart attack or stroke

	- protective life labs Fibrinogen activity level 193 - 507 mg/dL
	- self decode 175 - 425 mg/dL
	- Calgary lab services 160 - 410 mg/dL hearthrive lab
	- Dr. Stephen Sinatra in his book "Reverse Heart Disease Now" 180 - 350 mg/dL
	- life extension wants to see under 300 mg/dL
	- Christian Wilde researched fibrinogen in depth and places fibrinogen among his 
	  top six measurements to check for heart disease prevention advocates under 280 md/dL
	  above 385 mg/dL is high risk
	- one stricter resource is Dr. Nadir Ali states optimum level under 235 mg/dL
	  above 350 mg/dL high risk
	- if you want to err on the strictt side consider this range to optimal: 280 mg/dL or less and up to 
	  320 mg/dL is acceptable

	- certain supplement could help improve your fibrinogen level include vitamin C, fish oil and nattokinase
	- more details on how these supplements can help prevent clotting in module 5 of hearthrive
}

9 - Lp(a) [Lipoprotein Little "a"]
{
	- a variation of LDL or low density lipoprotein
	- when this value elevated it may be associated with a higher risk of heart disease
	- some people are genetically predisposed to having high Lp(a).
	- you won't know unless you get it checked at least one time.

	- many heart attacks occur in arteries that have blockages of 50% or less
	- you've probably heard stories of a person that suffers a heart attack quite suddenly
	  with no symptoms.

	- well, what happens is they have a plaque, it ruptures and a clot forms
	- the clot blocks the artery and the person has a heart attack
	- if you have Lp(a), the likelihood of that happening is much higher
	- Lp(a) is a variation of LDL, it has anohter attached protein and it
	  associate with a higher risk of heart disease and stroke 
	- in module 3 of hearthrive you'll learn that cholesterol is transported in the blood 
	  via lipoprotein particles
}

10 - Ferritin [Iron Storage]
{
	- this is a protein that binds to iron and thereby reflectr how much iron is stored
	in tissues in your body
	- too much iron creates more free radicals and increase oxidative stress and heart disease risk.

	- ferritin is another test that may reflect inflammation and an increased risk for heart disease
	- ferritin is a protein in the body that binds to iron, therefore, the amount of ferritin in your
	  body test gives an indication of how much iron is stored in your body
	- too much iron in your tissues is associated with having more free radicals and 
	  oxidative stress, in other words, inflammation
	- inflammation can damage arteries and set the stage for heart disease
	- Dr. Levy claims that 
	  "Heart Disease is especially sensitive to the negative effects of excess iron"
	- on the other hand a 2009 article in BMC medical Genomics says
	  "iron metabolism is very involved in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions
	   but the iron serum ferritin is not well correlated to iron distribution in the heart"
	- ferritin can be infeluenced by genetics
	- in other word, certain genes migh predispose you to storing too much iron
	- there is a snp or mutation that can be detected with genetic testing that is associated
	  with hemochromatosis, in other words, excess iron
	- will talk about this more in HEARThrive module 10 on Genetics
	- there are various health factors that can raise ferritin and hence infer some
	  inflammation is happening in your body examples:
	    - liver disease
	    - excess sugar and wheat gluten
	    - thyroid problems
	    - smoking
	    - too much stress
	    - abdominal obesity
	    - genetic hemochromatosis
	- if you discovered that you have high ferritin, you may need to find a doctor who is 
	  very proficient in understanding not only ferritin but also iron levels and percent
	  saturation for which there are readily available blood tests as well

	- malcom preior to his heart bypass surgery he had 6 ferritin tests in 2010
	- his lowest value was 96 ug/L, his highest was 146 ug/L
	- his value on april 8 2016 one month prior to his bypass was 121 ug/L and 
	  their doctors and cardiologist consider his ferritin levels to be well within 
	  acceptable level
	- doctor keith Scott-Mumby recommends a value under 275 ug/L for me and
	  under 175 ug/L for women.
	- in the book " Reverse Heart Disease Now" Dr. Stephen Sintra quotes a
	  1992 finnish study that found men with ferritin above 200 had a twofold
	  risk of heart disease
	- Dr, Mercola, Thomas Levy and Morley Robbins all agree that truly optimal
	  ferritin values need to be much lower in range of 60 - 80 ug/L
	- Robbins actually advocates 20 - 50 ug/L

	- it is possible to bring very high ferritin levels down by donating blood
	- be careful if you/re taking na iron supplement or if your mul;tivitamin contains 
	  iron and yet you don't know what your ferritin level is
	- most people especially men and post-menopausal women don't need to take extra iron
	  which will be explained in module 5 of Hearthrive on supplements

How to Convert U.S mg/dL to 
international mmol/L

divide by 18

90 mg/dL / 18 = 5 mmol/L


------------------
what i am thinking now is that, Insulin shows you if your body is having resistance which if getting a bit high means you are eating a bit more of
carbs and sugar foods so i look at the C-Peptide to make sure that this insulin is really upnormal and not the base of that person's body.
then i look at the HbA1c to know how much sugar is loaded into these blood cells which means with all the food and exercises the person practiced,
he could load that much sugar into his cells 

Lipid Panel HDL & Triglycerides is an individual path where it makes you able to ignore LDL (bad cholesterol) and focus on the triglycerides fat in your 
liver that increased with the increase of sugar in your blood Homocysteine in your blood causing



--------------[shortcut]----------
when you eatt sugar and carbs your glucose increases which force hemoglobin to carry sugar with 
with the oxygen making it a history of how poor is your diet for 3 months which is the period 
before your hemoglobin revoks, your liver will produce more triglycerides fats mainly from carbs 
and HDL will decrease, with the increase of glucose your blood sugar your body will be resistant 
to the insulin of your pancreas making the insulin not able to lower your blood sugar thus no
use of the insulin, and having too much insulin circulating your blood is an indicator of so much
sugar in your blood. 

mean while in the liver hsCRP will be manufactured which could bebecause of the bad diet which means
your body is inflammating. 

at the same time the sugar and carb you have eaten will depletes B vitamins, Magnesium which will make
you deficient in Methylatiion nutritions which will increase Homocysteine exposing you to heart disease 
and more Homocysteine will lower thyroid function known as hypothyroidism 


another reason causes depletes Methylatiion nutritions is problems with your gut including dysbiosis and 
insufficient stomach acid could also result in more absorption of B vitamins and magnesium and thereby cause 
Homocysteine to increase

another reason causes depletes Methylatiion nutritions is you maybe genetically predisposed to have high Homocysteine. 
you may have certain genetic mutations that impair the ability to absorb vitamins and magnesium thereby resulting in high 
homocysteine
