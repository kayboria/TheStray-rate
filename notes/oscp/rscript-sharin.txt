Walikumalsalam, 

Dr I really regret my computer had a virus and I had to format it. 

I  put effort on PSDA subject when I took it with you and created 8 scripts using R language to create the final project in PSDA and I remember I submitted it in elearning that time because you asked us to submit the scripts

These were the script and topics I created for:

ANOVA script. 
Hypothesis testing script 
Linear Regression script 
Correlation script 
Chi-Square Test
Goodness-of-fit test script 
...

The rest of scripts are details about these topics for example ANOVA equal sample and unequal sample scripts etc ...

All of them with drawing 


How I can contact the admin to retrieve the files Dr ?
